         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>The Tranſlator's PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
                  <p>THAT Tranſlations of Learned Authors in general, eſpecially if they be carefully under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tak'n, and prudently manag'd, are of great Uſe to the Publick, I think, after all that has been ſaid againſt 'em, no Perſon can reaſonably deny, or ev'n call into queſtion. For as the ſame Reaſons which may be aſſign'd, for the Commendation of a Fountain of Water, may as well be brought in Praiſe of the Streams, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from it, ſo far as they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly convey'd<hi>:</hi> So I think, the very ſame Arguments which are us'd in Favour of any Learned Original, will equally ſerve, to juſtifie, and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend a Tranſlation of it, ſo far as it anſwers its principal End, in convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60159:4"/>
to our Minds the true Sence of the Author.</p>
                  <p>And tho' I think, I may ſay, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Suſpicion of Vanity, that I have, in ſome meaſure employ'd my Time and Strength, in the Study of the Learned Languages, and that I highly value 'em, as the happy Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hicles of ſolid and uſeful Learning; yet the bare Language in which a Book is writ (let it be never ſo much extoll'd, as being learned, and copious, or eſteem'd for its Antiquity, native Majeſty, and inimitable Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs) is, I confeſs, one of the leaſt Things, which will ever recommend it to my Eſteem, and Peruſal.</p>
                  <p>For I humbly conceive, that in all our Studies we ſhou'd not ſo much nibble at Words, which are, as it were, but the Bark of the Tree of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, as aim at the Improvement of our Reaſon, which is a ſtrong Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection from the Deity, and affords abundant Matter of agreeable Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, to them, who are ſo happy, as to be diſtinguiſh'd from the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of Mankind, by a wonderful Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netration of Soul. And if an Author, by his natural Capacity, and acquir'd Abilities, do's make a more than ord'nary Figure in the intellectual and learned World, is an Honour to the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60159:4"/>
Age in which he flouriſh'd, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps equally the Wonder and Envy of ſucceeding Ages, I think, the more Reaſons may be aſſign'd, why he ſhou'd be cloath'd in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Language, which is moſt familiar to us, and is allow'd by all capable Judges, to be very expreſſive, copious, and charming. For certainly 'tis Pity, that ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe Treaſures of Sence and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhou'd be confin'd, to thoſe few Perſons, in a comparative Sence, who happen to underſtand the Language in which he writes, and like the vaſt Mines in <hi>Peru</hi> and <hi>Mexico,</hi> ſerve chiefly for the Convenience, and Delight of thoſe, who are Foreign to us, both by Blood, and by Religion.</p>
                  <p>And I have often thought, and 'tis the Opinion of many Perſons, who are far more capable of judging than my ſelf, that 'twou'd conduce very much to the Honour of the <hi>BRITISH NATION,</hi> to have the Fathers of the <hi>Three Firſt Centuries,</hi> thoſe Heroes of <hi>Antiquity,</hi> and <hi>Pillars</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtian Church,</hi> tranſlated into the Language of our Country, and cloath'd in ſo <hi>Modern</hi> and ſo Charming a Dreſs, if it be poſſible, that many of both Sexes, whoſe Genius and Education do's not lead 'em, to the Study of <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin,</hi> may be induc'd to read 'em,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60159:5"/>
and to ſquare their Lives by thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Rules of Vertue, and Piety, which they have laid down, for the Conduct of Others, and of which they were in their ſeveral Ages, and are ſtill, in ſome Sence, living, and <hi>highly honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable</hi> Examples.</p>
                  <p>And ſince, by the Policy of a Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Nation, the Language of <hi>Lewis</hi> the XIVth has already obtain'd that UNIVERSAL MONARCHY, to which he <hi>ſeems</hi> to aſpire, and ſince, many excellent Tranſlations, of which the <hi>French</hi> may juſtly boaſt, have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited and almoſt conſtrain'd, many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious and polite Perſons, to learn and admire their Language, and ſo perhaps they have been unhappily and inſenſibly won over to their <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Religion</hi> and <hi>Slaviſh Principles of Government,</hi> I think, 'tis not a little ſtrange, that we, who are ſo prone to a <hi>Phantaſtical Imitation</hi> of 'em, ſhou'd ſo much abound, in <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nneceſſary</hi> and <hi>Trifling Originals,</hi> and give ſo little Encouragement, to the Tranſlation of thoſe Ancient Authors, whom, in Spite of all our Ignorance and Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, we muſt acknowledge, to have been remarkable for their Learning, and whoſe Labours, ſince they were <hi>generally approv'd,</hi> and <hi>highly admir'd,</hi> in the <hi>Early</hi> and <hi>Pure Ages of the Church,</hi>
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:60159:5"/>
and ſince they ſtrangely confounded the <hi>Whole Heathen World,</hi> one wou'd think, might very well ſerve for our Confirmation, and delightful Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment. And tho' we deſervedly pay a <hi>moſt profound Reſpect</hi> to the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Hebrew Text</hi> of <hi>Scripture,</hi> as claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a ſtrict Senſe the Venerable Title of the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>GOD,</hi> and challenging in a ſpecial Manner the Time, and Strength of thoſe, whom God and Men have thought fit to employ, in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication and Defence of the Sacred Oracles; yet 'tis an extraordinary Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, which we in theſe Nations en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy, that we have ſuch excellent Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlations of the Bible, and ev'n the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People (who have precious and immortal Souls, as well as others, and want more Helps, for the regular and comfortable Diſcharge of their Duty) are ſo far from being commanded by their Miniſters, to avoid 'em, as being dangerous in unskillful Hands, and an imperfect Rule, both of Faith, and Manners, that they are ſtrictly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd, and with all imaginable Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs entreated, to read 'em, with the greateſt Seriouſneſs, Induſtry, and Pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>And if we have juſt Cauſe, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn God our moſt humble and hearty Thanks, for raiſing up, and inclining
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60159:6"/>
ſome proper Perſons, to undertake ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant and ſo difficult a Work, for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fording ſuch Meaſures of his gracious Aſſiſtance, as were neceſſary, to ſupport, and encourage 'em in it, and to bring it at laſt to a moſt honourable and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Accompliſhment, I think, the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlations of any pious, rational, and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Authors, whoſe Labours have a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, to lead us, into the <hi>true</hi> and <hi>deep Sence</hi> of the holy Scriptures, and to furniſh us with proper Weapons, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter the inveterate and moſt formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable Adverſaries of the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, muſt be very deſireable, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with no ſmall Advantages.</p>
                  <p>I confeſs, I am highly ſenſible, that Tranſlations do frequently abound with Faults, and perhaps with ſueh as are notorious, which ſhould a Perſon under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to juſtifie, he wou'd expoſe himſelf, to the Scorn, or Pity of the learned World, and to the Cenſure ev'n of the injudicious, and illiterate.</p>
                  <p>But this, if it be a ſolid Objection againſt bad Tranſlations, (which I hardly believe it is, ſince they may have many great Defects, and yet the Tranſlator ſhou'd be eſteem'd, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded for his good Will to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, and that Meaſure of Induſtry, and Skill in the learned Languages, which appears in his Work, tho' he
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60159:6"/>
deſerves far leſs Eſteem, than one, who happily accompliſhes ſome accurate Compoſition, or more compleat Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation,) I ſay this, if it be a ſolid Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt bad Tranſlations, wo'nt hold againſt ſuch as are good, and ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently and ſo highly uſeful, that ſhou'd any one exclaim againſt 'em, he would but betray his Folly, and provoke the Laughter, or ſilent Scorn, of thoſe, who are not as remarkable Triflers as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                  <p>For if no Tranſlator muſt appear in the World, who is not ſo induſtrious, and ſo correct, that he almoſt ſeems to be free, from thoſe Faults, to which the Frailty of humane Nature renders Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind unavoidably ſubject, if the Taſte of Readers is ſo nice, as to diſrelliſh the the moſt exact Tranſlations, that are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, by Reaſon of many great Defects, which inſenſibly creep, into the beſt hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Compoſitions, then the ſame Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument which is us'd againſt Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, will equally overthrow the moſt learned and uſeful <hi>Originals</hi> that ever were, and ev'n the ſacred Oracles of the ſupream and all-wiſe Being.</p>
                  <p>For tho' I think 'tis ridiculouſly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected againſt us, by the <hi>Atheiſts,</hi> and <hi>Deists,</hi> that ſome Faults have been found, in the beſt Verſions of the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and that the ſacred Original Text
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60159:7"/>
it ſelf thro' the long Tract of Time in which the Books of the Old and New Teſtament were committed to Writing, thro' the Ignorance, and Careleſneſs, and perhaps Deſign of ſome Tranſcribers, is liable to ſome few Exceptions; yet if we muſt reject and deſpiſe all Tranſlations, becauſe ſome are bad, and the beſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, I fear, we muſt immediately throw up our Bibles themſelves, and grope after Truth, by no better Help, than that of the dim Light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p>For all the Verſions of the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are allow'd to be the Works of Men, who were not immediately inſpir'd by the Spirit of GOD, tho' we have Reaſon to believe, he was pleas'd to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford 'em more than ord'nary Direction, and Influence, in an Affair which had ſo great a Tendency, to the Welfare of the <hi>Chriſtian Church,</hi> and ev'n to the happy and timely Conviction and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the moſt hardn'd Infidels, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whoſe Hands the Scriptures may fall, from Time to Time, and in which they made their ſerious, earneſt, frequent, and more ſolemn Addreſſes, to <hi>Almighty God,</hi> for all that gracious Aſſiſtance, which he ſaw was neceſſary or conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient for 'em.</p>

it with the <hi>Alexandrian Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript,</hi> the World is beholden to the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably Learned, Indefatigable,</hi> and <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious</hi> Dr. Grabe) all the Verſions, I ſay, were the Works of uninſpir'd Perſons, who were liable to many groſs Defects.</p>
                  <p>Nay, the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text of Scripture, thoſe ſacred and refreſhing Fountains of living Water, have been <hi>ſhamefully polluted,</hi> by <hi>humane Additions</hi> and <hi>curſed Innovations,</hi> tho' God in his wiſe and holy Providence has preſerv'd 'em, in all the Ages of the Church, ſo far <hi>uncorrupted</hi> in Spite, of all the Wit, Malice, and unweary'd Induſtry, of Men, and Devils, that they carry the lively and honourable Stamp of a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Authority, and are ſtill what they always were, a perfect Rule, both of Faith and Manners.</p>
                  <p>If then, we pay a more than ord'nary Deference, to the <hi>ſacred Originals of the Holy Scriptures,</hi> and if the ſmall Errors, in a comparative Sence, which are found in all the Verſions that were ever ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, ought by no means to ſhock our religious and firm Belief of the <hi>Divine Inſpiration</hi> of thoſe ſacred, and moſt valuable Records, then I think, 'tis ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently evident, that Tranſlations, in general, are of excellent and continual Uſe, and the Badneſs of ſome, and the Imperfections, which unavoidably
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60159:8"/>
attend 'em all, is no ſolid Argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe which are good, or even ſuch as are bad, if the <hi>Original</hi> was an Author who deſerv'd to be tranſlated, and ſo far as the Tranſlator diſcovers his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and does real Service to the Cauſe of Piety, Sence or Learning.</p>
                  <p>Another Objection that may be brought againſt Tranſlations is this, that the injudicious, and illiterate ſhou'd not dare to intrude into thoſe venerable Miſteries of the Empire of Reaſon, and Learning, which ſome are apt to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, 'tis their Prerogative, to conſult, and to underſtand, and the entire Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Advantage of which they think is a Debt, that ought only to be pay'd to Perſons of their Character, and Diſtinction.</p>
                  <p>But many, who aſſume to themſelves, the Title of Perſons, who are <hi>profound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly learned,</hi> eſpecially ſuch whoſe Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent lies chiefly in torturing ſuch Words as very ſeldom occur in Authors, whoſe Heads are living Dictionaries, or rather Libraries, the faithful but trifling Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitories of ſenſeleſs Criticiſms, which how great Satisfaction ſoever they may perhaps afford, to theſe eager and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Hunters of meer Words and Phraſes, are of little uſe; I ſay, many ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons have a much ſmaller Share, of <hi>ſolid Reaſon,</hi> than they whom theſe <hi>Tyrants</hi>
                     <pb n="11" facs="tcp:60159:8"/>
                     <hi>in the Empire of Learning</hi> would have to lie proſtrate at their Feet.</p>
                  <p>Beſides I can't for my Life conceive, why any Perſons how learned ſo ever they may eſteem themſelves to be, how knowing ſoever they may be accounted by others, who have gon in the ſame te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious, if not unprofitable Track of Study, and what Skill ſoever they may really have, in reading uncommon and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt obliterated Characters, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring almoſt an infinite Number of Worm-eaten and voluminous Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts, I ſay, I can't conceive, why ſuch Perſons ſhou'd deſire, and endeavour to engroſs all the Learning in the World to themſelves, make it ſerve like the <hi>Egyptian Hieroglyphicks,</hi> to amaze, but not inſtruct, or reform Mankind, and prevent the Generality of Men, from making Enquiries into Truth, which theſe fond Admirers of themſelves repreſent, as a Thing that's vaſtly beyond their Reach, and the Honour of Knowing, which ought by no means to be proſtituted to 'em.</p>
                  <p>For my Part, I confeſs, I cou'd never juſtifie, nor eaſily extenuate the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Practice of the <hi>Popiſh Priests,</hi> who forbid the Laity, to read ev'n the Holy Scriptures, which (if they are not ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd a <hi>meer Noſe of Wax,</hi> by their <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Traditions,</hi> and <hi>wrong Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,)</hi>
                     <pb n="12" facs="tcp:60159:9"/>
are able, under the Influence of the Holy Spirit, to make the injudicious and illiterate, ſo wiſe as to ſecure the Salvation of their Souls, (tho' not fit to diſpute, or manage an Intriegue, with ſubtil and deſigning <hi>Jeſuits)</hi> and can warm their Hearts, with a much deeper Impreſſion of the near Relation in which they ſtand both to GOD, and and to their Neighbour, and of thoſe pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Methods, which they ought to take, to perform their Duty, in the moſt pleaſant and profitable Manner, than ſome, of the moſt learned Doctors of the <hi>Sorbon</hi> can modeſtly pretend to have.</p>
                  <p>And whether ſuch Perſons of Intriegue don't diſcover as much Ignorance, as <hi>Antichriſtian Pride,</hi> in taking theſe irregular Meaſures, to gain the Eſteem, and command the Purſes of the People, to ſupport the Intereſt and raiſe the Reputation of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> which ſtands in Need of <hi>many pious Cheats</hi> to keep up it's <hi>Aſpiring</hi> (and yet perhaps <hi>ſinking) Hierarchy,</hi> is a Matter, that deſerves to be tak'n into our ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and moſt deliberate Thoughts.</p>
                  <p>And tho' I firmly believe, that our Bleſſed Saviour has appointed an Order of Men, which ſhall continue, ev'n to the End of the World, to preach his Goſpel, and adminiſter his Holy Sacraments, and I earneſtly deſire, that my Tongue
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60159:9"/>
may cleave to the Roof of my Mouth, if I don't prefer 'em before Multitudes of thoſe, who, thro' the Influence of Satan, the <hi>curſed Policy</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Diſorder of their Bodies, their wretched Ignorance of the happy Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement of the ſacred Canon, or the Reputation they expect to gain, by af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting to make high Pretences, to <hi>new Light,</hi> and <hi>immediate Inſpiration;</hi> yet I am far from thinking, that the Chriſtian Religion was deſign'd to feed the bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Ambition, and in ſo extravagant a Manner to raiſe the Reputation, and ſupport the <hi>External Grandeur</hi> of the Clergy.</p>
                  <p>And if the Scriptures ſhou'd be fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently and ſeriouſly conſider'd by all, to whom its Precepts, Promiſes, and Threatnings are directed, if the <hi>deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Prieſts</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> are guilty of a notorious Crime, in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending, that the common People ſhou'd n't dare, to intrude into thoſe Sacred Myſteries, that are contain'd in 'em, if they ought to lye always open for the Information and Conduct of thoſe, who moſt need their Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, then no pious, rational, and learned Authors ſhou'd be deny'd the <hi>Laity,</hi> but, like the Public Service, which they pay to Almighty God, ſhou'd be offer'd to their Conſideration,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:60159:10"/>
in that Language which is moſt fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to 'em.</p>
                  <p>I don't affirm, that they who wou'd hinder Perſons of mean Capacities, and inconſiderable, acquir'd Abilities, from enjoying the Satisfaction, and reap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Advantage of learned Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, are as guilty, as the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Prieſts, who deny the People, that Word which alone is able, by the Bleſſing of Almighty God, to make 'em holy in this World, and compleatly and eternally happy in the World to come; tho' I think, that they, who are eminent for Learning, may, with a much better Grace, affirm, that 'tis their Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, to conſult learned Authors, than the <hi>Popiſh Clergy</hi> can pretend, that the common People muſt be blind Votaries to the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> that they muſt not underſtand the Language, in which their Divine Service is perform'd, and their Religion, and by conſequence their Everlaſting Salvation, muſt depend on the Qualifications, and Intention of thoſe, who officiate for 'em.</p>
                  <p>But if 'tis the Duty of the common People to read the Word of God, and to perform all their Acts of Devotion, in the Language of their Native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, if they, who are unable, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Sacred and Original Text of Scripture, ſhou'd have the Bible
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60159:10"/>
tranſlated into a Language, that is fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar to 'em, this ſeems to me, to be a ſolid Argument, to prove, that any uſeful Original which they don't un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, in the Language in which the Author writ, ſhou'd be cloath'd in ſuch a Dreſs, as may render it intelligible, and eaſie to 'em.</p>
                  <p>For my part, I am far from being bigotted to any ancient Authors, tho' I hope, they will be ever valu'd, in Proportion to that Vein of Sence, Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or Piety, which often runs, as it were, thro' the whole Body of their Diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p>I am not ſuch a Slave to Antiquity, as to judge it a Crime, to read the Writings of thoſe Modern Authors, in which any Thing in its own Nature valuable, do's occur, and Sir <hi>William Temple,</hi> in his <hi>Eſſay upon Ancient and Modern Learning,</hi> as Ingenious and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite a Perſon as he was, and as much as I am charm'd with his Writings, do's pay, I think, too great a Defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Ancients, and give too mean a Character of the <hi>Modern Heroes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But whether Ancient or Late Authors do deſerve the Preference, that the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of Tranſlations ſhou'd be any Hindrance to the Reputation, and ſucceſsful Progreſs ev'n of <hi>Ancient Learning,</hi> is, what I confeſs, after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:60159:11"/>
Deliberation, I am not able to conceive.</p>
                  <p>For as for thoſe, who are entirely, and perhaps culpably ignorant of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes of Antiquity, and have no Skill in any of the Learned Languages, 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, that Tranſlations ſhou'd leſſen their Eſteem for thoſe Authors, who bear the awful Stamp of very diſtant Periods of Time.</p>
                  <p>Nay, this is ſo far, from being the true State of the Caſe, that I do not ſee, 'tis poſſible for the common People, to have any high and well-grounded Reſpect, for the genuine Monuments of Antiquity, but by Means of thoſe very Tranſlations, which they, who make the Objection, do moſt ſeverely condemn.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true, they may hear it reported, that the Fathers of the <hi>Primitive Church</hi> were very pious, rational, and learned Writers, but their Knowledge, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Opinion, is not the natural Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of their own Examination, and Judgement, and, by Conſequence, the Eſteem which they have, and expreſs for 'em, muſt be highly irrational, or at beſt uncertain, and extreamly ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial.</p>
                  <p>But when any of the Ancient and Learned Authors are, as it were, rais'd from the dead, and cloath'd in a Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:60159:11"/>
which they perfectly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, and they have carefully perus'd a Tranſlation of 'em, by one, who, as they have Reaſon to believe, did perfectly underſtand the Language, in which the Author writ, and was Maſter of the Subject, and whoſe Fidelity they have ſcarce a Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſuſpect, they then begin, to entertain a very honourable Opinion of 'em, and thank the Tranſlator, for ſaving 'em the Pains, of underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and conſulting the Original.</p>
                  <p>And as for thoſe, who have Skill, in the learned Languages, I don't ſee, that a Tranſlation of any Ancient and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Authors can do 'em any real Prejudice. For certainly the Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor muſt be void ev'n of common Sence, and very illiterate himſelf, if he deſires 'em to pay a greater Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the Tranſlation, than they ought to pay to the Original.</p>
                  <p>This wou'd be, to prefer the Stream before the Fountain, from which it proceeds, which wou'd be monſtrouſly abſurd, and can't fairly be ſuppos'd, in ſo Judicious and Learned an Age as this. And one, who underſtands the Languages, is ſo far from being hinder'd hereby, from the Study of 'em, or diſcourag'd from paying 'em a due Reſpect, that a Tranſlation, if
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:60159:12"/>
it be but tolerably perform'd, is a Help to him, in conſulting the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and tends, to cultivate his Skill, in the learned Language, in which the Author writ.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, we muſt conſider, that no Tranſlator, who has common Sence, will deſire, that they, who are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundly learned, ſhou'd lay aſide the Original, for the Sake of a Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but only allow ſome Time, and take Pains to compare 'em, and ſee whether he has hit on the true Sence of the Author, and if he has really done ſo, the Tranſlation muſt be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lu'd of Courſe, unleſs the Original be eſteem'd for nothing, but the Words; which I believe, no rational Perſon will ever be tempted to imagine.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall ſay no more of the Benefit and Neceſſity of Tranſlations in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; but offer ſomething concerning that Author, whom, I have, in Part, tranſlated, with a due Regard, I hope, to the Glory of God, and the Publick Good, tho' whether I have perform'd well, or not, I muſt leave to the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Learned, at whoſe Bar I ſhall think it an Honour to be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign'd, if I have been guilty of any groſs Defects, and whoſe Friendly Cenſures, I ſhall willingly, and ev'n thankfully undergo.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="19" facs="tcp:60159:12"/>
That <hi>ORIGEN</hi> flouriſh'd in the <hi>Third Century,</hi> and in the Infancy, if I may ſo ſay, of the <hi>Chriſtian Church,</hi> is ſo generally known, that it ſeems almoſt needleſs, to mention it.</p>
                  <p>And ſince we deſervedly, and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully pay a Deference, to the living Monuments of Antiquity, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to thoſe Pious and Learned Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, who liv'd in the <hi>Early</hi> and <hi>Pure Ages</hi> of the Church, partly thro' a natural Curioſity, to know the Names, Characters, and Works of the moſt Eminent Perſons, who flouriſh'd in ſuch diſtant Periods of Time, partly thro' a Senſe of thoſe <hi>Miraculous</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods, which the Great God was, as it were, oblig'd to take for the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and Encouragement of the Church, during its Minority, and partly from a juſt and deep Conviction, of the Eminent Piety, Profound Judgment, and Univerſal Learning of many of the <hi>Primitive Fathers,</hi> I think, a more than ord'nary Veneration ſhou'd be paid, to the Memory of the Deceaſed <hi>ORIGEN,</hi> and eſpecially to his Books againſt the <hi>Ingenious</hi> and <hi>Learned CELS<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S,</hi> which are a lively Picture of his Capacious and Exalted Genius.</p>
                  <p>Need I ſay any Thing in Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of his Piety, or rather, will not every Thing, that I can ſay, fall vaſtly
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:60159:13"/>
ſhort of the Dignity of the Awful Subject?</p>
                  <p>Will it not in ſome Sence, and in ſome Meaſure, loſe its native and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt unſully'd Luſtre, by the faint Encomiums of the moſt elevated Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, who are inſpir'd with a tremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous Senſe of his <hi>Majeſtick Simplicity,</hi> and irreſiſtible, and almoſt inimitable Charms?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A Piety,</hi> which was ſo ſincere, and ſo impatient of Reſtraint, that 'tis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported of him, that when his Honoured Father was ſuffering under the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror <hi>DECI<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S,</hi> he wou'd, ev'n in his tender Years, have ſaluted the Flames of Martyrdom, with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Readineſs, and ev'n <hi>Triumphant Joy,</hi> had not his Dear and Honour'd Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by her maternal Authority, Arts of Perſwaſion, and innocent Methods of Female Policy, clip'd the flutt'ring Wings of his humbly-aſpiring Soul.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A Piety,</hi> diſcover'd, by denying ev'n the lawful Appetite of his ſordid Fleſh, and looking with a generous Diſdain on the outward Grandeur, and periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Vanities of this lower World.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A Piety,</hi> which was ſeen, by his Leaving, or, in a comparative Sence, Deſpiſing the School of <hi>Plato,</hi> that Celebrated Heathen Philoſopher, for the Sake of the meek and perſecuted

                  <p>Need I ſay any Thing of his Sence, who cou'd n't content himſelf, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the <hi>ſevere Study of Philoſophy,</hi> and the <hi>ſublime Notions</hi> of the Divine <hi>Plato,</hi> in particular, and familiarly convers'd with the moſt judicious Philoſophers among the <hi>Pagans,</hi> and greatly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd the refin'd and uſeful Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; which he eagerly imbib'd, from thoſe <hi>Stars</hi> in the <hi>Firmament</hi> of <hi>Learning,</hi> by lighting his Torch, if I may ſo ſay, at the dazling Rays of the <hi>Sun</hi> of <hi>Righteouſneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Need I ſay any Thing of his <hi>Learning,</hi> who, on that Account, was juſtly the Wonder, and has too often been the Envy of the <hi>Heathen</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian</hi> World, who by reaſon of his ſolid Sence, and uncommon acquir'd Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:60159:14"/>
was inclin'd, and qualify'd, to take an unconfined Range, thro' the immenſe Spaces of the <hi>Intellectual Aether,</hi> who by the Number, and Choice of the Books he publiſh'd (of which <hi>Euſebius</hi> gives us an Account, in his <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory)</hi> diſcover'd at once the Regularity, and almoſt infinite Compaſs of his Studies, and by his Travels into Foreign Countries, was fully acquainted with the Poſture of Affairs, both in the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Church, and in the Learned World?</p>
                  <p>I can't but take Notice, by the Way, that if <hi>ORIGEN</hi> had been ſo mean a Man, or his Works ſo dangerous, as Cardinal <hi>Baronius,</hi> Cardinal <hi>Noris, Gretzerus</hi> the <hi>Jeſuite,</hi> and ſome others repreſent him, I wonder, that Pope <hi>Anaſtaſius,</hi> a whole Council, the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd Perſons, and the whole <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinian</hi> Age, ſhou'd ſo violently oppoſe him.</p>
                  <p>I confeſs, after all that I have ſaid, which is little, if compar'd with what I cou'd eaſily offer, in the Praiſe of <hi>ORIGEN,</hi> I dare not ſay, that St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> that very Learned Father, and afterwards the <hi>Juſtinian</hi> Age, and many Others ſince, had no Colour of Reaſon, for what they alledg'd againſt him.</p>
                  <p>Indeed, the Wiſdom of God does very plainly appear, in ſo ord'ring
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:60159:14"/>
Matters, that ev'n ſome of the Sacred Penmen of Holy Scripture, and the Brighteſt Lights that ever ſhone in the Glorious Orb of the Church of God, had ſome Defects, to allay their intrinſick and apparent Worth, and prevent that Exceſſive Veneration, which wou'd otherwiſe have been paid 'em, by reaſon of their Natural and Acquir'd Accompliſhments, the Honour they reflected on the Ages, in which they flouriſh'd, and the extraordinary Service, they did the Cauſe of Chriſt, and the Common Wealth of Learning.</p>
                  <p>But as the Tranſlators of the Bible wou'd have been unjuſtly treated, had they been reproach'd with ev'n ſeeming to countenance, the falſe No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Things, which the Generality of the <hi>Jewiſh,</hi> and many of the Leaders of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Church, are known to have entertain'd, or had they been up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braided, as if they approv'd of <hi>David</hi>'s Murder and Adultery, and St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s moſt ſhameful Denial of our Bleſſed Lord: So I may rationally expect, that the Reader will be ſo juſt and candid, as not to imagine (as great a Man as <hi>ORIGEN himſelf</hi> was, and as great a Heroe of <hi>Antiquity,</hi> and <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> as I know he was) that I'm ſo very ignorant, as to agree with him, in thoſe Opinions, or Practices,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60159:15"/>
which are evidently, and greatly liable to cenſure.</p>
                  <p>As for his Notion, that the <hi>Devils may be recover'd;</hi> I muſt confeſs, it ſeems to me to be both a falſe, and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Poſition; falſe, becauſe there's no Colour for it, that I can ſee, in the Word of God; and dangerous, becauſe it has a Tendency to encourage Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to go on in Sin, in Hopes, that ev'n the Fire of Hell will be at laſt extinguiſh'd, and be but a <hi>Second Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory.</hi> We know, that no leſs a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, than the Late Moſt Reverend Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> has publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appear'd in its Defence, and has offer'd ſuch <hi>plauſible Arguments,</hi> that perhaps it may ſeem difficult to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute His Grace.</p>
                  <p>But as I have much more Reaſon to doubt, of my own Salvation, than of the Eternal Happineſs of that <hi>ſingularly Pious,</hi> as well as <hi>incomparably Rational,</hi> and <hi>very Learned Prelate,</hi> ſo I am fully ſatisfy'd, that <hi>ORIGEN</hi> will be a <hi>Star</hi> of the <hi>Firſt Magnitude,</hi> in the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Orbs, and tho' his Notions might in ſome Reſpects be peculiar to him, and juſtly deſerve our Cenſure; yet the chief Thing in us, which the Great God regards, and on which he will put diſtinguiſhing Marks of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, thro' all the Revolutions of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,

                  <p>But be that Matter as it will, St. <hi>Hierom</hi> himſelf, who ſtrongly oppos'd his Errors, had no ſmall Veneration for him, on the Account of his Piety, Sence, and Learning.</p>

cast upon 'em, as if a Confutation of him were not legible in the Things themſelves, and what he offers might not be deſervedly rejected, as wanting ev'n the <hi>Appearance of Truth</hi> to recommend it to the World.

At laſt came two falſe Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, and ſaid, this Fellow ſaid, I am able to deſtroy the Temple of God, and to build it in three Days. And the High-Prieſt aroſe, and ſaid to him, anſwereſt thou nothing? What is it which theſe witneſs againſt thee? But Jeſus held his Peace.</hi> We read in another Place of the ſame Evangelist, that <hi>our Saviour</hi> return'd no Anſwer to the Perſons who accus'd him. <hi>And Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi>

                           <hi>Then ſays</hi> Pilate <hi>unto him, heareſt thou not how many Things theſe witneſs againſt thee? And he anſwer'd him never a Word, inſomuch that the Governor marvell'd greatly.</hi> And indeed it cou'd n't but be admir'd by Perſons who were least capable of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, that when he had ſo fair an Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to free himſelf from the heavy Charge that was brought against him, to enumerate, or at least, modestly inſinuate his <hi>ſhining Characters,</hi> and to commend <hi>the higher Powers, as being ordam'd of God,</hi> and by <hi>theſe innocent</hi> and <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick Methods</hi> to procure the Judge's Favour, I ſay, that when he had ſo fair an Opportunity to do all this, he ſhou'd be ſo far from embracing it, as to look upon his most violent Accuſers with a <hi>truly-generous</hi> Diſdain.</p>
                        <p>That the Judge ſeem'd willing to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit him, had he made his Apology, is plain from the following Words, <hi>Whom</hi>

When I had proceeded in my Anſwer to <hi>Celſus,</hi> as far as the Place where he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonates the <hi>Jew</hi> diſcourſing with our <hi>Bleſſed Saviour,</hi> I thought, 'twou'd be proper to put this Preface before my Book, that ſo any One into whoſe Hands it may accidentally fall, may plainly ſee, that I didn't principally intend it for <hi>thoſe Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,</hi> who are <hi>fully ſatisfy'd</hi> in their Judgment, but either for them who are <hi>entire Strangers</hi> to the Excellency of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> or for them who are weak in the Faith, as the Apostle calls 'em. <hi>Him that is weak in the Faith</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Rom. 14. <hi>v.</hi> 1.</note>

                        </p>
                        <p>I must add one Thing here; and that is this, that I have a diff'rent Deſign in anſwering <hi>Celſus</hi> in the groſs, from what I had in Anſwering the Beginning of his Book. For at first, I deſign'd no more than to mention ſome of the <hi>Principal Heads,</hi> and content my ſelf with a <hi>meer Compendium,</hi> But after mature Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration, I thought, twou'd be much more proper, to gather my Diſcourſe, as it were, into a perfect Syſtem or Body. Then I was ſatisfy'd from the reaſon of the Thing, that I ſhou'd be at a needleſs Expence both of Time and Pains, and contented my ſelf with what I had writ, against the <hi>Beginning</hi> of the Book, which <hi>Celſus</hi> publiſh'd.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="42" facs="tcp:60159:24"/>
But in the remaining Part of my Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, which (if I may modeſtly ſay it of my own Performance) is much more elaborate, I determin'd to bend all my Forces againſt him, and to return a full Anſwer to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Thing that ſeem'd to be material, and ev'n to ſome of his <hi>moſt trifling Objections.</hi> I muſt, therefore, deſire my Reader to diſcover <hi>a more than ord'nary Candor</hi> in paſſing his Judgment on what I have done, eſpecially on that Part of my Apology, which <hi>immediately follows</hi> this Epiſtle. And if the other Parts ſhou'd have no better Effect upon him, I hope, he will there alſo be extreamly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable in the Sentence, which he may paſs upon me.</p>
                        <p>And, if you, Virtuous <hi>Ambroſius,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire a more compleat Anſwer to <hi>Celſus,</hi> than that which I ſhall give him at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, I muſt refer you to them, who have <hi>a far greater Share</hi> of Judgment, than that to which <hi>I lay my moſt humble Claim,</hi> and are <hi>better qualify'd</hi> for the <hi>due</hi> and <hi>honourable</hi> Management of <hi>ſo difficult</hi> a Province. However that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſeems to me, to be in a ſafer and much more deſirable Condition, who having met with <hi>Celſus</hi>'s Performance, and being furniſh'd by <hi>his own Experience</hi> with a <hi>warm</hi> and <hi>effectual Apology</hi> for that <hi>excellent Religion</hi> which he profeſſes, and endeavours to practice to the utmoſt

                           <p>Since, therefore, he makes his Boaſt that he has the Law on his Side, and wou'd intimate, that the ſeparate Meetings of the Chriſtians did coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and promote <hi>Schiſm</hi> and <hi>Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> I anſwer, that as a Stranger, who has his Lot providentially caſt among the <hi>Scythians,</hi> who are govern'd by moſt wicked Laws, and has not a fair Opportunity to make a ſafe Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape, wou'd be eſteem'd by that igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and unciviliz'd People, as an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to their Conſtitution, and a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourer of the <hi>Sectaries,</hi> if he didn't comply with the <hi>Canons of the Church,</hi> but might ſtill urge weighty and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwerable Arguments to juſtify his <hi>Separation:</hi> So the Chriſtians might lawfully <hi>diſſent from the Eſtabliſh'd Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> which introduc'd Image-Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and a whole Rifraff of the Mock-Deities of the Heathens, and abounded with more horrid Impieties than were ever practic'd by the moſt barbarous Nations of the World.</p>

                           <p>To this I anſwer, That they who bring down the juſt Judgments of God upon their Heads by their notorious Crimes, wou'd never ſuffer by the Hand of Divine and Inflexible Juſtice,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:60159:28"/>
if all Mankind had not ſome tolerable Notions of Moral Good and Evil.</p>
                           <p>Therefore we needn't wonder, that God, who is the common Father of his Creatures, ſhou'd plant in the Minds of Men thoſe natural Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, which the Prophets, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally our Bleſſed Saviour do's ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently impreſs upon the Minds of Men, that <hi>So every one might be left without Excuſe at the Day of Judgment, having had the Sence and Substance of the Law engrav'd upon his Heart in very legible Characters.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>This was obſcurely repreſented to us by the Scripture, which ſpeaks of God's Writing the Two Tables of the Law, as it were, with his Finger, and his giving 'em to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and acquaints us, that they were afterwards broke by the Wickedneſs of them, who made the Golden Calf (as if it had been ſaid, that they were broke by the Sins of Men) and that when the Law was writ the ſecond Time on Tables of Stone, he deliver'd 'em to <hi>Moſes,</hi> to ſignifie, that the Law which was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fac'd by the Original Apoſtacy, ſhou'd be re impreſs'd on the Minds of Men by the Preaching of the Goſpel.</p>

                           <p>To this I anſwer, That ſince I have already granted that ſome common Notions of Moral Good and Evil are originally implanted in the Minds of Men, we needn't wonder that <hi>Hera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clitus</hi> and Others, whether <hi>Greeks</hi> or <hi>Barbarians,</hi> have publickly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd

it can't be deny'd, that there are the ſame in Philoſphy. For ev'n the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers held ſome Opinions which they kept more ſecret.

Here I may take Occaſion to charge him, with the groſs Inconſiſtency of his Diſcourſe; for in ſome Places of his Book, he talks like a zealous Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lower of the admir'd <hi>Epicurus,</hi> but here, that his Accuſation may carry the more plauſible Appearance, he diſſembles his Opinions, and ſeems to hold, that there is in Man, beſides his Body, which is material and earthly, another and much nobler Subſtance, that has an Affinity with God himſelf, and ſays, <hi>That they, who have Souls duly diſpos'd, do, as far as the Frailty of their Nature will admit, aſpire to a Participation of the Nature of God, to which they are ſo nearly ally'd, and are never more highly pleas'd, than when they are ſeaſonably and ſolidly entertain'd with Diſcourſes concerning the Supream and Adorable Majeſty both of Earth and Heav'n.</hi>

For as theſe Impoſtors having once got the Aſcendant over the common People, who were groſly ignorant, cou'd turn and wind theſe harmleſs Cattle, as their Intereſt or Fancy might direct<hi>:</hi> So, he ſays, the very ſame Thing was known to be the common Practice of the Chriſtians.</p>

                           <p>To this I anſwer, that if all Men cou'd conveniently leave the Concerns of Life, and had Leiſure and Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to bend their Minds to the Study of Philoſophy. I ſhou'd heartily wiſh, that this might become a Univerſal Practice, tho' (to ſpeak modeſtly, and to keep within due Compaſs) I think, I may ſafely ſay, that the ſublime Doctrines of the <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> the ſhort Hints of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Prophets, our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s Parables, and abundance of other Things that are Simbolically de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd, and propos'd with the Sanction of a Law, are not more involved, and

attended with greater Obſcurity, than many of the Opinions which are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd and maintain'd by the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers themſelves. But if the Method which I have mention'd, and before recommended, be impracticable, partly by Reaſon of Men's natural Incapaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, who, for the moſt Part, are very unfit to apply their Minds to Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and partly by Reaſon of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and unavoidable Cares which attend Humane Life, what better Way cou'd any one have contriv'd, and tak'n, more ſuited to the Genius, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Circumſtances of the common People, than that which our <hi>Bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi> took, for the Converſion of a degenerate World? And as for the vaſt Numbers of Perſons, who have left thoſe horrid Debaucheries, in which they formerly wallow'd, and have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd to embrace the <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> I ask, which of the two Methods con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces moſt to their Advantage, and has the moſt natural and remarkable Tendency to the general Benefit of the Humane Race, to reform their Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, from a Senſe of thoſe moſt grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Torments, which the juſt God will be, as it were, conſtrain'd to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict upon the wicked, and of that bright and maſſy Crown, which waits for the Righteous, and which they

will receive, when this frail and ſhort Life is ended, tho' they don't ſtand to examine the Grounds on which their Faith is built, according to the ſtrict Rules of Art, or to defer their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, 'till they have a fair Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, and Capacity, to apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to rational, and learned Studies?</p>
                           <p>For Experience may convince us, that very few, in a comparative Sence, will advance ev'n ſo far as this, and reap the Benefit of yielding a naked, but well-grounded Aſſent to the Truths of the <hi>Christian Religion;</hi> but inſtead of that, the greateſt Part of Mankind are fully bent upon a vicious Courſe of Life.</p>

                           <p>THE Love of God therefore, in ſending his Son into the World, do's very plainly appear, in accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modating Matters to the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of Humane Life, that ſo the Goſpel might be of more general Advantage to the World, and this is none of the leaſt Powerful Arguments, to prove that our <hi>Bleſſed Saviour</hi> had
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:60159:34"/>
a Divine Commiſſion: For, if a Man, who has any Manner of Religion, will readily acknowledge, that a Phyſitian, who recovers ſick Perſons, is ſent from God, tho' the Cure do's extend no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the Bodies of his Patients, much more muſt we ackowledge, that our <hi>Saviour</hi> was indeed ſent by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who has recover'd ſo many Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of Perſons from ſpiritual, and more dangerous Diſtempers, has improv'd the Faculties of their Minds, and prevail'd with 'em, to depend upon the Will, and Providence of God, to refer all their Actions to the pleaſing of him, and to uſe their utmoſt Care, leſt they incur his juſt and ſevere Diſpleaſure, by Thought, Word, or Deed; and ſince our Adverſaries are continually making ſuch a Stir, about our taking Things on Truſt, I anſwer, that we who ſee plainly, and have found the vaſt Advantage, that the common Sort of People do manifeſtly, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently reap thereby, who make up by far the greater Number, I ſay, We, who are ſo well advis'd of theſe Things, do profeſſedly teach <hi>them</hi> to believe, without <hi>a ſevere Examination,</hi> who can't neglect their worldly Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, and ſpare Time enough, to make long and exact Enquiries into the Grounds of our Holy Religion.</p>

And our Enemies themſelves, tho' they wo'n't confeſs it, do the very ſame Thing, by which we incur their Cenſure. For when any one of them, do's firſt devote his Time and Strength to the Study of Philoſophy, and either by ſome unexpected Accident, or the Tutor, who is firſt recommended to his Choice, is determin'd to fall in with a particular Sect; don't he take it for granted, that he has pitch'd on the moſt happy Method? For he do'sn't ſtay 'till he has heard, and weigh'd the Arguments, that may be brought for one Sect, and againſt another, and ſo at laſt chooſe to be a <hi>Stoick, Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonick, Peripatetick,</hi> or <hi>Epicurean</hi> Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher, or the like. For, 'tis by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Impulſe, in which Reaſon is little or not at all concern'd, that the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference is frequently given to the <hi>Stoick</hi> Philoſophy, for Inſtance, and the <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonick</hi> is deſpis'd, as being leſs ſublime than the reſt; and the <hi>Peripatetick,</hi> as giving too great an Indulgence to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Frailty, and repreſenting, more than any other Sect, thoſe Things to be truly good, which are generally, but very unjuſtly reputed to be ſo.</p>
                           <p>And there are ſome, who being, as it were, thunder-ſtruck, at the very mention of an over-ruling Providence, by reaſon of its unequal Diſtribution of
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:60159:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>
its Favours, as they imagine, do raſhly deny that there is any ſuch Thing, and fondly embrace the corrupt and wild Notions of <hi>Epicurus.</hi> If, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, according to the Dictates of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, we muſt joyn our ſelves to ſome Sect of Philoſophers or other, either among the <hi>Greeks</hi> or <hi>Barbarians,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out weighing all the Arguments which may be brought on either Side; how much more juſt and reaſonable is it, that we ſhou'd believe him who is <hi>GOD over all,</hi> and our Bleſſed Saviour, who teaches, that this <hi>God alone</hi> is to be worſhipp'd, and that we ſhou'd raiſe our Minds above thoſe Things, which can hardly be ſaid to have a true Exiſtence, or at beſt are very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper Objects of Divine Adoration?</p>
                           <p>'Tis true, that only one, who makes Uſe of <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>ſevere Study</hi> in exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining the Principles he holds, is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of building his Faith on <hi>rational Demonſtration.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>But ſince we are forc'd to take many Things on Truſt, ev'n in the moſt common and neceſſary Affairs of Humane Life, is it not highly agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Dictates of ſolid Reaſon, that we ſhou'd immediately and firmly believe in God, and in him alone?

his Ground, that will not hope the beſt, tho' nothing is more common than to meet with frequent and great Diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments?</p>
                           <p>And if in our ordinary and daily Concerns, we overlook the uncertain Events of Things, and are encourag'd by the pleaſing Proſpect which our Faith and Hope do already give us, how much more Reaſon is there for one, who puts his Truſt in God, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the deſir'd Succeſs of any impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Action, than there is for one who goes by Sea, or is employ'd in any worldly Affair, I ſay, how much more Reaſon is there for ſuch a One, to place his entire Confidence in God, the glorious Creator of the ſpacious Univerſe, and in our Bleſſed Saviour, who in his infinite Wiſdom, thought it fit to recommend his excellent Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine to the whole habitable World, by ſuffering for Mankind not only cruel Perſecutions, but alſo a Death, which in ſome Sence, was highly ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominious, and by his own moſt He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick Example, at once taught and encourag'd the firſt Publiſhers of the Goſpel boldly to encounter the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Difficulties, and the moſt apparent Dangers, if they might but be honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably and happily inſtrumental to ſave precious and immortal Souls.</p>

But if they refuſe to comply with this moſt reaſonable, and highly neceſſary Requeſt which I make to 'em, and run into their</hi> Common Cant, <hi>and ſay,</hi> Don't examine into Matters, but believe; <hi>ſure 'tis fit at leaſt, that they ſhou'd be ſo civil, as to tell me what Notions they advance, and whence their Original was deriv'd.</hi>

                           <p>For if he had read the Prophets, which are full of very obſcure Hints, myſtical Repreſentations, and Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, that every One don't eaſily, or
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:60159:37"/>
perhaps tolerably underſtand, and if he had carefully, and candidly read the Parables, that are ſcattered up and down in the Goſpels, and thoſe Parts of Scripture, which contain the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Law and Hiſtory, and if hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing read the Writings of the Apoſtles without a Tincture of Prejudice, he had put himſelf in a Capacity of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding their genuine Meaning, and full Deſign, he wou'dn't, with ſuch an Air of Confidence, have boaſted, that he was perfectly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with all the Opinions which the Chriſtians hold.</p>
                           <p>For no Divine, ev'n among our ſelves, whoſe conſtant, laborious, and almoſt entire Employment it is, to be converſant with thoſe ſacred Writings, do's dare to talk with ſuch an Air of Vanity.

                           <p>But perhaps <hi>Celſus</hi> might borrow this bold Expreſſion from ſome ignorant People, who were not ſenſible, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they knew nothing at all, and I'm apt to think, that theſe were the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found

                           <p>'Tis juſt the ſame Thing, as if any one ſhou'd ſay, that the <hi>Platonicks,</hi> who believe the Immortality of the Soul, and the Doctrine of its Tranſmigration, have embrac'd ridiculous Opinions; that is, they are ſuch in the Judgment of the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> who endeavour to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw it, and of the <hi>Peripateticks,</hi> who inſult over <hi>Plato,</hi> as if he were a Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; and of the <hi>Epicureans,</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach them that believe a God, and an over-ruling Providence, as being the unhappy Authors of all the wild Superſtition, that was ever brought into the World.</p>
                           <p>And if there were Occaſion, I cou'd make it appear, that tho' 'tis much better for them, who have Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and Capacity, to build their Faith on rational and convincing Arguments, than to take Things on Truſt; yet our Bleſſed Saviour wou'd have Perſons of mean Capacities, and under ſome peculiar Circumſtances, to believe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>a ſevere Examination,</hi> ſince other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we can't ſuppoſe, that the Goſpel

                           <p>For if all other Hiſtorians have giv'n a faithful Account of the Antiquities of the ſeveral Nations from which they ſprung, why ſhou'd the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Writers be the only Perſons in the World ſuſpected of groſs Deceit? And if <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets have ſaid many Things in Favour of the <hi>Jews,</hi> may not the very ſame Thing be charg'd upon all, or far the greateſt Part of prophane Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians.

the <hi>Jews</hi> as a ſtrange Sort of People, and believe, that all that the <hi>Jews</hi> ſay againſt the <hi>Egyptians, viz.</hi> That they treated 'em in a moſt barbarous Manner, and for that Reaſon were juſtly and ſeverely puniſh'd by God, is a ridiculous Fable? I might ſay the ſame Thing of the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> who, if we may believe their own Hiſtorians, were anciently engag'd in long and bloody Wars with thoſe of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation.

                           </p>
                           <p>See therefore, how <hi>Celſus</hi> is led aſide by Prejudice which he's ſo ready to charge others with, when he readily believes ſome Nations to be extreamly wiſe, and highly eſteems their Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, as being entirely authentick, and condemns thoſe of other Nations as being falſe, and void ev'n of common Sence.</p>

                           <p>'Tis reported alſo, that <hi>Hermippus</hi> in his firſt Book <gap reason="foreign">

                           <p>But I wonder in my Heart how it comes to paſs, that <hi>Celſus</hi> ſhou'd reckon up the <hi>Odryſae, Samothracians, Eleuſinii,</hi> and <hi>Hyperborei,</hi> as being famous at once for their Wiſdom, and Antiquity, and make no mention of the <hi>Jews,</hi> for the <hi>Egyptians, Phoenicians,</hi> and <hi>Greeks,</hi> do by their own Hiſtory, give ſufficient and ample Teſtimony to the Antiquity of that People, which, I thought, 'twas needleſs for me to produce. For any one, that reads <hi>Joſephus</hi>'s two Books of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Antiquities, may ſee there a long Catalogue of Authors, who confirm the Truth of this Matter by their concurring Teſtimony. And <hi>Tatian,</hi>
                              <pb n="77" facs="tcp:60159:41"/>
who writ after him, has made a learned Diſcourſe againſt the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> wherein he quotes abundance of Authors, who have writ concerning the <hi>Antiquity</hi> of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and of <hi>Moſes</hi> in particular.</p>
                           <p>So that <hi>Celſus</hi> ſeems to me to talk at this extravagant Rate, rather from implacable Malice, than out of Zeal for Truth, deſigning to reproach the Chriſtian Religion (which has ſo cloſe a Connection with that of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation) on the Account of its Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, which he ſuppoſes to be late and mean. And he ſays, that the <hi>Galactophagi</hi> of <hi>Homer,</hi> the <hi>Druids</hi> of the <hi>Gauls,</hi> and the <hi>Getae</hi> (who agreed with the <hi>Jews</hi> in ſome Opinions, but have no Writings extant, that I know of) are remarkable for their Wiſdom and Antiquity. But he levels all his Malice at the <hi>Jews,</hi> and will neither allow 'em to be wiſe nor ancient.</p>
                           <p>Then giving us a Catalogue of wiſe and ancient Perſons, who were uſeful to their Contemporaries by their bright Example, and to Poſterity by their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Writings, he has purpoſely left <hi>Moſes</hi> out of the Number of Men remarkable for their Wiſdom, tho' <hi>Linus,</hi> who is put at the Head of 'em, has left behind him no Laws, nor Books, for the Regulation of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties, or Reformation of Manners,

whereas <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Laws are diligently obſerv'd by an entire and populous Nation, by whoſe Means they have been diffus'd, almoſt thro' the whole habitable World.</p>
                           <p>Take Notice therefore, of the unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable Malice by which <hi>Celſus</hi> is acted, who ſays nothing of <hi>Moſes,</hi> but mentions <hi>Linus, Muſaeus, Orpheus, Phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recydes, Zoroaſter</hi> the <hi>Perſian,</hi> and <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras,</hi> with abundance of Honour, as having giv'n wiſe and wholeſom Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts to Mankind, and tak'n prudent and due Care to tranſmit 'em to Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity by their Writings, which are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant at this very Day.</p>
                           <p>And I ſuppoſe, he deſignedly omitted to ſpeak of the ridiculous Fables (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the Writings of <hi>Orpheus)</hi> which attribute humane, and ev'n ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant Paſſions to their pretended Deities.</p>

on the Minds of Men, and impartially conſider how few of the Writings of thoſe celebrated Authors, which you have reckon'd up, had any tolerable Effect, eſpecially on the common People, ſince, according to your own Confeſſion, they were deſign'd for them, who were capable of underſtanding Allegories.

                           <p>And I don't ſee, I confeſs, that the Works of your Poets, with all their Wiſdom, are preſerv'd, what Service ſoever they might do the Publick.

ſhou'd carry along with 'em that Force and Efficacy, without which 'twas im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for 'em ſo readily, and ſo uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally to obtain.</p>

To which I anſwer, that this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of his do's naturally, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidably lead me to a difficult and important Queſtion concerning the true Nature of Names, whether, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> thinks, they depend entirely on Inſtitution, and Choice, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, according to the Opinion of the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> they have their Foundation originally laid in Nature, Words be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing firſt form'd on the Model of Things themſelves, in Imitation of which, Names, and the Elements of <hi>Etymo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy</hi> were happily introduc'd into the World, or whether, as <hi>Epicurus</hi> thinks, who differs from the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> they have their Foundation partly laid in Nature, and are partly owing to Accident, and Contrivance, the firſt Men having un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſignedly affix'd ſuch and ſuch arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate Sounds to ſuch and ſuch Objects, of which they had form'd, and wou'd convey an Idea.</p>
                           <p>If therefore, I can make it appear, that ſome Names have a natural, and by conſequence an inſeparable Efficacy, (ſuch as the Wiſe Men among the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,</hi> or the <hi>Brachmans,</hi> or <hi>Samanaei</hi> of the <hi>Indians,</hi> or the Wiſe Men of any other Nations do conſtantly make uſe of) and if I can prove, that the Art which is commonly call'd by the Name of <hi>Magick</hi> is not <hi>abſolutely</hi> incongruous
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:60159:50" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to Reaſon, as the Followers of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Epicurus</hi> think it is, but has certain ſtated Rules, as they that are skill'd in it do know, and can eaſily demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, I ſay, if I can make this appear, I think, I may then ſafely affirm, that the Name <hi>Sabaoth, Adonai,</hi> and other Names, for which the <hi>Jews</hi> have ſo profound a Veneration, were not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd to denominate any created Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, much leſs thoſe of an inferiour Order, but do contain ſome <hi>ſacred My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery,</hi> which has an immediate Refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the great and adorable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the Univerſe. Theſe Names therefore, have an Efficacy, when they are duly pronounc'd by any Perſon whatſoever.</p>
                           <p>There are other Names, which, being pronounc'd in the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Language, are prevalent with certain <hi>Daemons,</hi> whoſe Power is limited to ſuch or ſuch a Sphere, and others, which being pronounc'd in the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi> Language, are prevalent with other <hi>Daemons.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>And I might inſtance in ſeveral Nations of the World, that uſe other Names, applying 'em in very different Sences, and ſo we ſhall find that the terreſtrial <hi>Daemons,</hi> which have parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Places aſſign'd 'em, have Names giv'n 'em, according to the Language
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:60159:50" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which the People ſpeak. Any Man of Sence therefore, one wou'd think, that beſtows but the leaſt Thought on this important Subject, will ſcruple to make uſe of Names foreign to the Things which they repreſent, leaſt he ſhou'd unawares, be guilty of the ſame Fault with them, who uſe ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper and harſh Expreſſions concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God himſelf, that they don't at all ſtick to give him the falſe, and vile Appellation of inanimate Matter, or run into the Error of thoſe unhappy Perſons, who greatly derogate from the infinite Honour which is due to the ſupream and original Cauſe, and diſparage true Virtue, and Piety, by miſ-applying the Sacred Name of <hi>Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum Bonum,</hi> to a little glittering, but periſhing Duſt, or a happy Conſtitution of Body, or that which is falſely, but too commonly call'd an Honourable Deſcent, Noble, Princely, or Royal Blood. And ſurely the Danger of miſ-applying the Name of the <hi>Aweful Majesty of Heav'n,</hi> or the <hi>Chief Good,</hi> is at leaſt equal to that of changing the ſtated Names, which are us'd in <hi>Magick</hi> and have a Myſtical Sence, and giving the Names of Superiour Powers to infernal Spirits, and on the contrary, thoſe of infernal Spirits to Superiour Powers.</p>

I need not ſay, that at the very men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Jupiter</hi> is underſtood the Son of <hi>Saturn,</hi> and <hi>Rhea,</hi> the Husband of <hi>Juno,</hi> the Brother of <hi>Neptune,</hi> the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Minerva,</hi> and <hi>Diana,</hi> and the Perſon that committed Inceſt with his Daughter, nor need I ſay, that at the mention of <hi>Apollo,</hi> is underſtood the Son of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and <hi>Latona,</hi> the Brother of <hi>Diana,</hi> and Brother to <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi> by the Fathers ſide, or need I ſpeak of many other Things that were related by the Ancient Heroes (whom <hi>Celſus</hi> has, with ſo much Honour enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated) or contain'd in the old, and admir'd Theology of the learned <hi>Greeks.</hi>

                           <p>This Conſideration, I think, has a manifeſt Tendency to favour, and juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy the Practice of thoſe Perſons, who have ſome myſtical but ſolid Reaſon for uſing the Name <hi>Sabaoth,</hi> or <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donai,</hi> and ſome other Names when they ſpeak of <hi>GOD,</hi> ſince they who underſtand any Thing of the true Nature of Names, will eaſily find

that ſome <hi>ſacred Myſtery</hi> is veil'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Names which are giv'n to the Angels, one of whom is call'd <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael,</hi> another <hi>Gabriel,</hi> and another <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phael,</hi> each having a Name affix'd to him by the Father of Spirits, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Nature and Extent of that honourable Work, in which his great Creator has thought fit to employ him.</p>
                           <p>And the Virtue which accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the Pronunciation of our Saviour's Name, and by which cruel and obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate <hi>Daemons</hi> were frequently, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly diſpoſſeſs'd both of the Minds and Bodies of Men, muſt, I think, be reſolv'd, at leaſt in ſome Meaſure, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the natural Efficacy of Names. I might add one Thing here, and that is this, that they who are skill'd in Enchantments, tell us, that if they make uſe of ſuch and ſuch Words in the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Language, the End propos'd will certainly be obtain'd, but if the very ſame Words be chang'd, and others be made uſe of, which convey the very ſame Idea, they will immediately, and ſtrangely loſe their extraordinary Virtue.</p>
                           <p>So that the Power which they have, is not owing to the Things of which they are the external Signs, but to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>unknown Properties,</hi> that belong to the Names themſelves.</p>

                                 <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pſtart Sect,</hi> who from him are call'd by the Name of <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> He ſays, <hi>That our Saviour appearing in the World, and introducing his Doctrine but a few Years ago, was (for what Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons he knows not) tak'n by the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians for the Son of God, in a ſtrict and proper Sence.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="102" facs="tcp:60159:54"/>
To which I anſwer, that when our Saviour did ſo lately introduce his Doctrine, it ſhou'd meet with ſuch wonderful and happy Succeſs, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in ev'ry Part of the whole habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table World a great Number both of <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Barbarians,</hi> of learned and unlearned Perſons, ſhou'd ſo rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily, and ev'n triumphantly forſake the Religion in which they were born, and bred, and to which they were pre-engag'd by many other ſtrong, and almoſt indiſſoluble Ties, and on a ſudden diſcover ſo extraordinary a Zeal for a new Religion, as to be willing to ſacrifice their Reputation, their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, and ev'n their Lives for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of it, (which can hardly be ſaid of any other Doctrine, which has all external Advantages to recommend it.) I ſay, when the Poſture of Affairs is ſuch, we muſt be ſtrangely blinded by the Force of Prejudice, it we don't ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a more than ordinary Appearance of the Providence of God, in ſo ſudden, ſo remarkable, and ſo bleſſed a Change as this.</p>
                           <p>I think, I may ſafely ſay (not to ſpeak from Prejudice, but as one who deſires and endeavours to make impartial En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries into Truth) that a skillful Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician can't recover his Patients ev'n from their bodily Diſeaſes without the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:60159:54" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Bleſſing of Almighty God upon the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Methods he preſcribes.</p>
                           <p>And if any one can cure the more fatal Diſtempers of the Soul, can ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, and in a conſiderable meaſure, diſpoſſeſs thoſe rooted and dangerous Vices, that have for a long Tract of Time uſurp'd and maintain'd a Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion there, can free it from its former, and in ſome Sence, <hi>Native Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rante,</hi> Injuſtice, Contempt, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanation of holy Things, and, as a Proof of his Skill, can inſtance in an hundred Perſons, whoſe Manners he has been happily, and greatly inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental to reform, I preſume, you will not ſay, that this can be done without a ſeaſonable, and more than common Interpoſition of the Providence of God.</p>
                           <p>If then any Perſon, who weighs theſe Things in the Ballance of his ſerious and deliberate Thoughts, will of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity acknowledge, that much of the Natural, and all the Moral Good, of which the whole World can boaſt, is owing to ſome higher Cauſe, than a <hi>General Concourſe</hi> of the Supream and and All-wiſe Being, how much more juſtly, and more eminently may this be ſaid in Commendation of our Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour, if we compare the Courſe of Life which his Followers once ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norantly and unhappily led, with the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:60159:55" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Tenor of their future Converſation, and conſider how willingly, and ev'n greedily they devoted themſelves to Debauchery, Fraud, and Avarice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they made a Profeſſion of that holy Religion, which the Bleſſed Jeſus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduc'd into the World, (which in the Judgment of the <hi>Epicureans</hi> was a Notorious Cheat, and the greateſt Plague with which Mankind cou'd poſſibly have been infected) but in Proceſs of Time were illuſtrious Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the contrary Virtues, inſomuch that ſome of 'em from a ſincere and vehement Deſire of attaining to an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Degree of Purity, and of Devoting themſelves more entirely to the Service of God, did abſtain from the lawful Delights of <hi>Senſe,</hi> and thoſe <hi>rational Entertainments</hi> which Marriage it ſelf affords.</p>
                           <p>And any one who examines into theſe Matters, with that Diligence and Exactneſs which is requiſite, will eaſily perceive, that our Saviour, with a Greatneſs of Soul that was peculiar to him, attempted what was vaſtly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Sphere of <hi>meer humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> and that the Event did moſt remarkably anſwer his Deſign.</p>
                           <p>For when ev'ry Thing look'd with an unfavourable Aſpect, on ſo great, and ſeemingly ſo bold an Undertaking,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:60159:55"/>
and threaten'd, that the Goſpel ſhou'd be confin'd to a very narrow Compaſs, when the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors in their ſucceſſive Reigns, the Governors of Provinces, and Generals of Armies, the Magiſtrates of particular Cities, the Soldiers, and the common People, in a Word, when all Perſons that were in Places of Authority, or had any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, and Influence, declar'd open War againſt the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> I ſay, ev'n then, under all thoſe evident and great <hi>external Diſadvantages,</hi> it bore the ſacred and undeniable Marks of a Divine Original, approv'd it ſelf to the Conſciences of the moſt wicked Men, forc'd its Way, in Spite of the united Malice, and moſt vigorous Efforts both of Earth and Hell, gain'd ground by the moſt violent Oppoſition, and being ſuperiour to all its Enemies, which were neither few, nor contemptible, and having a wonderful Power over the Minds of Men, all <hi>Greece,</hi> and a great Part of the moſt barbarous Nations, became Trophies of Honour to the Immortal Memory of its God-like Founder.</p>

                              <hi>Celſus</hi> introduces him, making his Addreſs to our bleſſed Saviour, and pretending to convince him of ſeveral Points, and the firſt Thing of which he endeavours to convince him, is, that the Account of his being born of a Virgin is an empty and ridiculous Fable.</p>
                           <p>Then he reproaches him <hi>with being born at an obſcure Village, and having a Woman to his Mother, that got her Live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyhood by going out to Service, who,</hi> he ſays, <hi>being convicted of Adultery, was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorc'd from her Husband, who was a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter by Trade.</hi>

Things, eſpecially ſuch as are of the laſt Conſequence to the Souls of Men, 'till I come by ſlow Degrees, to their true Originals, I ſay, to me theſe Things are ſo far from giving an unhappy Shock, that they are no ſmall Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of that important Truth, that our Bleſſed Lord is the very Perſon, whom the Prophets foretold to be the Son of God, and the Saviour of the World. I can't deny, but that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly a Man's Deſcent from rich and honourable Parents, and Enjoyment of the Advantage of a liberal Education, do's not a little conduce to blazon his Name, and command Reverence from Perſons of an inferior Rank<hi>:</hi> But when one who labours, in the greateſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree imaginable, under the contrary external Inconveniencies, can ſpread his Fame to the moſt diſtant Regions of the World, in Spite of his mean Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, and the fond Opinions which are too often receiv'd by aſpiring Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, and climb the higher up the ſteep Aſcent of Honour, by reaſon of the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Oppoſition which is made againſt him, who, if he has any Spark of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature left, can forbear to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire a Soul of the ſame Rank of Beings with himſelf, ſo ſtrangely elevated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the common Pitch, and ſo nearly approaching to the Deity, ſo capable of
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:60159:58"/>
forming well-laid, deep, and truly ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Deſigns, and of crowning all by a happy and anſwerable Execution?</p>
                           <p>If we make a ſerious and narrow Enquiry into the Matter, ſhall we not be ready and ev'n conſtrain'd to think thus with our ſelves, was it poſſible, that one who was born of poor and ignoble Parents, and was not inſtructed in the Liberal Arts, and Sciences, whereby he might have been render'd capable of inſinuating himſelf into the People, and of engaging their Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and their Purſes in his Service, ſhou'd ſo work upon the Paſſions of Men, by an inviſible Power, and the naked Evidence of Truth, as almoſt univerſally to gain their Credit and Eſteem, tho' the Doctrine which he introduc'd was in a great meaſure new, a Doctrine, which, without derogating in the leaſt from any of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, did aboliſh the <hi>Moſaick</hi> Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, and make void the Laws of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> eſpecially thoſe, which had an immediate Relation to Religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, in which they were ſo groſly ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant?</p>
                           <p>Is it not ſtrange, and ev'n prodigious to a Miracle, that one who ev'n accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Confeſſion of his Enemies, was ſo meanly born, and bred, and by conſequence was very unfit to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:60159:58"/>
an Intriegue, which requires a Chain of Thought, and continu'd Thread of Artifice, ſhou'd ſo move the ſecret Springs of humane Souls, and ſo powerfully incline 'em againſt their ſtrongeſt Inclinations, by encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging the righteous with a pleaſing Proſpect of a glorious and eternal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in the World of pure and perfect Spirits, and by repreſenting to the wicked, as in a Glaſs, thoſe dreadful Torments which they muſt expect to ſuffer, when they ſhall fall into the Hands of the living God, I ſay, is it not ſtrange, and ev'n prodigious to a Miracle, that ſuch a one, ſhou'd not only engage ignorant, and illiterate Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to embrace his Doctrine, but alſo a great Number of the rational and learned World, who, under the ſacred Veil of naked Truths cou'd diſcern un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathomable Depths of ſupernatural Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, diſplay'd with all the Art that a God cou'd ſhew?</p>
                           <p>I remember <hi>Plato</hi> relates a Story of one that was born at <hi>Seriphos,</hi> who upbraiding <hi>Themiſtocles,</hi> a Famous Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, ſaid, that the Reputation he had happily eſtabliſh'd was not owing to his Merit, but his happ'ning to be born at a famous City of <hi>Greece,</hi> whereupon <hi>Themistocles,</hi> who was ſenſible, and gratefully acknowledg'd, that the Place

of his Nativity had no ſmall Tendency to render his Name immortal, return'd him this judicious and diverting Anſwer, <q>If I had been born (ſaid he) at <hi>Seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phos,</hi> I ſhou'dn't have been ſo famous as I am, but if you had been born at <hi>Athens,</hi> you wou'd never have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>Themiſtocles.</hi>

                           <p>AND 'tis Matter of Wonder, that our Saviour's Diſciples, who, in the Judgment of our Enemies, were not Eye-Witneſſes of the Truth of his triumphant Reſurrection, and ſaw no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what was common and ev'n contemptible in his Perſon, ſhou'dn't be afraid to imitate him in his Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, to encounter the moſt immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and threat'ning Dangers, and leave their Native Country, to publiſh the Doctrine which their crucify'd, but bleſſed Lord had taught 'em.</p>
                           <p>For I believe that no Perſon, who, laying aſide his Prejudice, examines theſe Matters duely, will ſay, that they

wou'd ever have undergone the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue of Ttinerant Preaching, if they had not been fully perſwaded of the vaſt Obligations that lay upon 'em, both from Reaſon, and Gratitude, not only to conform their Manners to the holy Precepts of the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, but alſo to do what lay in their Power, to bring many others under the ſame honourable, and happy Bonds, when, as Matters went at that Critical Juncture, they were ſure to incur the Diſpleaſure of the Heathen World, who were zealous for their ancient Laws and Cuſtoms, and cou'dn't en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the leaſt ſeeming Innovation, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially with reſpect to the pompous Ceremonies of their religious Worſhip. But all theſe Difficulties were light, and trivial, in the Eſteem of thoſe, who had Courage, not only to prove to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation, that our Bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour was frequently, and expreſly fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told by their own Prophetick Oracles, but alſo to make it appear to others, as Occaſion offer'd, that this very Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was the true <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> who was crucify'd but t'other Day, and willingly, and ev'n chearfully laid down his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Life for the whole Race of Men, after the ſame manner, tho' with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable Advantage, in which ſome others have ſacrific'd all that's near

                           <p>For there are ſome ſecret Reaſons in Nature, which very few underſtand, why the Death of one virtuous Man, who readily ſuffers the greateſt Evils that can poſſibly befall him, for the real and perhaps laſting Welfare of the Place of his Nativity, ſhou'd deſtroy, or at leaſt ſeverely check, the uſurp'd Power of thoſe infernal <hi>Daemons,</hi> who are the Cauſe of Plagues, Famines, Storms, and the like evident and great Diſorders, which frequently happen in the World.

                           <p>BUT 'tis Time to return to the <hi>Jew,</hi> whom <hi>Celſus</hi> perſonates, who ſays, <hi>That the Virgin</hi> Mary <hi>being big with Child, was divorc'd by her Husband the Carpenter, for committing Adultery with one</hi> Panthera, <hi>a Soldier, and being got with Child by that ſcandalous Wretch.</hi> Let us ſee therefore, whether the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventors of this Story don't give a falſe, and obſcure Account of the Matter, and whether by all that they have to ſay, they are able to overthrow the Doctrine of our Saviour's miraculous Conception by the over-ſhadowing of the Holy Ghoſt? For ſo ſurprizing a Paſſage as this is, might very eaſily be falſify'd, and 'twas poſſible, they might deny the Truth of it, tho' they were inwardly convinc'd, that our Saviour was not conceiv'd in the common Way of humane Generation. And methinks, it wou'dn't have been incongruous at all, that they who didn't believe, or rather wou'dn't acknowledge the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, ſhou'd invent a Fiction, to ſerve their malicious and baſe Deſign.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="120" facs="tcp:60159:63"/>
But to invent one, that was ſo far from having a plauſible Appearance, that 'twas a great, and notorious Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth, was to diſcover their Weakneſs to them, who are able to diſtinguiſh Truth from Falſehood.</p>
                           <p>For do's it ſtand to Reaſon, that one, who was ſo uſeful to the World in general, and expreſs'd a moſt ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Concern, both for the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and <hi>Barbarians,</hi> that they might reform their Manners, from a Senſe of a Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and Aweful Judgment, and do what lay in their Power, to gain the Favour of the Bleſſed God, the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and Supream Diſpoſer of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, I ſay, do's it ſtand to Reaſon, that ſuch a one, ſo ſerviceable to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the Glory of God, and the Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of precious and immortal Souls, ſhou'd be ſo far from being born in a miraculous Way, as to be of a baſe, and illegitimate Extraction?</p>
                           <p>I ask the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and particularly <hi>Celſus,</hi> (who, whether he be a <hi>Platoniſt</hi> or no, thinks he has ſufficient Authority for what he ſays, if he do's but quote a Paſſage out of the learned <hi>Plato,)</hi> whether it be not a Reflection upon one, who holds the Doctrine of the <hi>Tranſmigration of Souls,</hi> and by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, that every Body has a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Soul to act, and animate it, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:60159:63" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that our Saviour was born in a lawful Manner, who engag'd in ſo difficult and important a Work, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed ſo many ignorant and ſeduc'd Perſons, and happily, and ſuddenly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd 'em from that Deluge of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morality, in which they had been ſo long, and ſo deeply plung'd. Is it not more rational to think, according to the Opinion of <hi>Pythagoras, Plato,</hi> and <hi>Empedocles,</hi> (on the Teſtimony of which learned Authors, <hi>Celſus</hi> himſelf do's very much rely) that there are ſome ſecret Reaſons, why every Soul ſhou'd have a Body appropriated to it ſelf, that is a fit Receptacle for it, and ſuited to the good, or bad Qualities, which it had in its State of Pre-exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? Is it not juſt, and reaſonable, that a more than humane Soul, that do's more Service to the World, than many Thouſands of others (to ſay no more, leſt my Diſcourſe ſhou'd be thought to ſavour of Prejudice) ſhou'd be united to a Portion of Organiz'd Matter, that is more excellent than the Generality of Bodies are?</p>
                           <p>For if thoſe Souls, which by the Virtue of ſome ſecret Cauſes, are of too noble a Nature, to be united to an inanimate Creature, and are not worthy to animate a Body, that is compleatly form'd, have one that is
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:60159:64"/>
adapted to 'em, the Head of which being diſproportionable to the reſt of its Members, do's in a great Meaſure hinder the free Exerciſe of Reaſon, and others, that are more perfect, act a Body that is more duly diſpos'd, and ſo others, according to the ſeveral Degrees of their native, or acquir'd Excellencies, are ſent into more or leſs perfect Bodies, why may not a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Soul aſſume a Body in a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous Way, a Body, that has ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in common with the reſt of Men, that may render it fit for hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Converſation, and ſomething wherein it differs from 'em, that may in ſome Meaſure, ſecure it from the ſad Contagion of a neighbouring, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper'd Mind. In ſhort, if we give any Credit to them, who are skill'd in <hi>Phyſiog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Zopyrus, Loxus, Polemon,</hi> and others, who have directly handl'd that difficult Subject, and pretend to find out extraordinary Myſteries, by obſerving the Rules which that Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence propoſes, what Abſurdity is there in aſſerting, that all Bodies are ſuited to the Qualities of the Soul that acts 'em?</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="123" facs="tcp:60159:64"/>
Is there then the leaſt Probability, that a Soul, ſo excellent in it ſelf, and form'd for ſuch great, and truly-ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Deſigns, as the Humane Soul of our Bleſſed Saviour, ſhou'd animate a Body, which, as <hi>Celſus</hi> repreſents the Matter, was begotten in Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, by a wicked Souldier, on the Body of a luſtful Female? One wou'd rather think, that a Mad-man, or a Perſon, who prov'd a conſtant Plague to the Age, and Place he liv'd in, or a Teacher of Intemperance, and Injuſtice, and an impudent Encourager of all Manner of Vice, ſhou'd owe his Birth to ſo impure a Copulation, and not a Teacher, much leſs an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent Practicer, of Temperance, Juſtice, and all other Virtues.</p>

                           <p>THIS was plainly foretold by the Prophet, and exactly agrees with the promis'd Sign, that we read of in the Prophecy of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> where 'tis ſaid, <hi>That our Bleſſed Saviour wou'd, by the Courſe of his Actions, make good his Name, and prove himſelf to be</hi> Emmanuel, <hi>God with us.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>And I think it may not be impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, to mention the Prediction of the fore-mention'd Prophet, that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſhou'd be born of a Virgin, which <hi>Celſus</hi> takes no Notice of, tho' he pretends to be perfectly acquainted with what the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> hold, either not having read it, or cunningly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing his Knowledge, leſt he ſhou'd unawares overthrow his own belov'd Opinions, and advance any Thing to the Prejudice of the Cauſe, which he eſpouſes, and uſes his utmoſt Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to maintain.</p>
                           <p>The Words of the Prophecy are theſe, <hi>Moreover the Lord ſpake again to</hi> Ahaz, <note place="margin">Iſaiah vii. V. 10.</note>

                              <pb n="125" facs="tcp:60159:65"/>
                              <hi>God, ask it either in the Depth, or in the Height above. But</hi> Ahaz <hi>ſaid, I will not ask, neither will I tempt the Lord, and he ſaid, hear ye now, O Houſe of</hi> David, <hi>is it a ſmall thing to weary Men? But will ye weary my God alſo? Therefore the Lord himſelf ſhall give you a Sign, Behold a Virgin ſhall conceive, and bear a Son, and call his Name</hi> Emmanuel.</p>
                           <p>That <hi>Celſus</hi> diſcover'd his Malice, in not mentioning the fore-going Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, I gather, from his paſſing over it in a profound Silence, when he quotes ſome Paſſages in St. <hi>Mathew</hi>'s Goſpel, and particularly makes mention of the Star, that appear'd at the Nativity of our Bleſſed Saviour.</p>
                           <p>But if the <hi>Jew,</hi> whom <hi>Celſus</hi> perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates, being us'd to make critical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks on Words, ſhou'd tell us that the Word, which is tranſlated <hi>Virgin,</hi> ſhou'd be render'd <hi>Young Woman,</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Word <gap reason="foreign">

                           <p>
                              <hi>The Lord ſaid to</hi> Ahaz, <hi>ask thee a Sign of the Lord thy God. either in the Depth, or in the Height above,</hi> Then 'tis ſaid, that this Sign was to be giv'n, <hi>Behold a Virgin ſhall conceive, and bear a Son.</hi> But what Sign cou'd a young Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's Conceiving be, if it was not meant of a Virgin? And to which of the two, is it moſt proper to attribute the Conception of <hi>Emmanuel,</hi> that is, <hi>God with us,</hi> to a young Woman with Child, in an unlawful, and diſhonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Way, or to one, who had not loſt her Virginity? Certainly, 'tis moſt agreeable to the Dictates of Reaſon, to ſuppoſe, that ſo extraordinary a Perſon was conceiv'd by the latter, in a ſtrange, and ev'n miraculous Way.</p>

And if the <hi>Jew</hi> lays ſuch a mighty Streſs upon thoſe Words, <hi>Ask thee a Sign of the Lord thy God;</hi> I ſhou'd be glad to know, what Perſon was born, in the Reign of <hi>Ahaz,</hi> of whom it might be ſaid, <hi>This is Emmanuel;</hi> which being interpreted, is, <hi>God with us.</hi> And if no ſuch Perſon can be found, I think, we may fairly underſtand this Text of our Bleſſed Saviour, who, as the Scriptures acquaint us, was to be born of the Seed of <hi>David,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Fleſh, and the following Words, <hi>In the Height above, or in the Depths below,</hi> have a manifeſt Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with what is ſaid of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, <hi>He that deſcended, is the ſame that</hi>

                           <p>THIS I ſay to a <hi>Jew,</hi> who, if he obſerves his Character, muſt give his ready, and firm Aſſent to the Truth of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Prophecies. And I ask <hi>Celſus,</hi> and thoſe of his Party, did the Prophets foreſee Things to come, or did they not? If they did not fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee 'em, what ſhou'd make 'em ſpeak with ſuch an Air of Aſſurance, and how comes it to paſs, that the whole <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation has all along look'd upon their Prophecies, as divinely-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpir'd Oracles? And, ſince I am natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally led, into a Diſcourſe concerning the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Prophets, I hope, that what I ſhall offer on this important Head, may not only, by the Bleſſing of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, be of ſome Uſe to the <hi>Jews,</hi> who believe that they <hi>were divine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-inſpir'd,</hi> but alſo to as many of the <hi>Greeks</hi> themſelves, as act upon ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Principles. For they muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that the <hi>Jews</hi> had true Prophets among 'em, unleſs we cou'd ſuppoſe 'em, to have a ſufficient Warrant, for vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:60159:67"/>
their <hi>divinely-inſtituted</hi> Rites, and paying Divine Worſhip, as a juſt Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to the Mock-Deities of Foreign Nations.</p>
                           <p>I prove my Aſſertion thus, We read in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Law, <hi>That other Nations</hi> 
                              <note place="margin">Deu. xviii. V. 10.</note>

<pb n="130" facs="tcp:60159:68" rendition="simple:additions"/>
was deliver'd by 'em to Writing, but either have had Recourſe to the Heathen Oracles, or have practic'd ſomething in Imitation of 'em, in their Native Country.</p>
                           <p>And it was not in the leaſt abſurd, that the Prophets, for the Satisfaction of ſome Perſons, who deſir'd it, ſhou'd propheſy concerning Matters, that ſeem'd to be of mean Importance, as <hi>Samuel</hi> did, concerning ſome Aſſes that <note place="margin">1 Sam. ix.

                           <p>And indeed, if they had no Prophets among 'em, how cou'd any, that were zealous for the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Law, reprove them, who conſulted the Heathen Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles?

                           <p>Theſe didn't only, in the general, foretel ſome Things, that wou'd come to paſs, with reference to our Bleſſed Saviour, and the remarkable Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions of Empires, and Change of the Face of Affairs in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

                           <p>I Have this to ſay farther to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> who wo'n't believe, that our Saviour was born of a Virgin, that the Creator of the World, if he pleaſes, can make ev'ry Animal bring forth its young, in the ſame wonderful manner, that is obſerv'd of ſome inanimate Creatures, and nothing hinders, but he may cauſe, if he pleaſes, the like unuſual Productions in the World of Men.</p>
                           <p>For among Animals, there are ſome Females, that bring forth their young, without any previous Copulation with the Males, as, for Inſtance, the <hi>Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> which propagate their Kind in this uncommon Way, as the beſt Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:60159:69"/>

                           <p>And the <hi>Greeks</hi> themſelves do rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily acknowledge, that ſome Men have come into the World, without the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of Man and Woman. For if the World had a Beginning, as many of 'em grant it had, then the firſt Man was not produc'd in the common Way, but, according to them, by the <hi>Sperma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Vertue</hi> of the Earth, which, to me ſeems much more ſtrange, and unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable, than our Saviour's Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, if we do but follow the Dictates of impartial Reaſon, ſince the Way in which he was born, has ſome Reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance with the uſual Method of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Copulation.</p>

For either they wrought Miracles, or they did not. 'Tis abſurd to ſuppoſe, they did no Miracles at all, but barely relying on the Authority of a Doctrine, which did not, like the Logick of the Schools, recommend it ſelf to carnal Reaſon, had the Courage to promote a new diſcountenanc'd Religion. And if they wrought Miracles, do's it ſtand to Reaſon, that a Company of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians ſhou'd agree, to expoſe themſelves to imminent Danger, and the greateſt Inconveniencies imaginable, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote a Doctrine, that condemns the Uſe of the very Art they practic'd?

And having ſaid enough, as he imagines, to prove, that our Saviour wasn't born of a Virgin, he continues his Diſcourſe, but don't treat of Things, in the Order of Time, in which they came to paſs, (for inveterate Malice can never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, to be confin'd to a regular Method) and talks, like thoſe ſhatter-brain'd Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, whoſe Heat, and undue Paſſion, do's ſo tranſport 'em, beyond the Bounds of Reaſon, that they don't ſtick, to ſay whatever comes into their Minds, and ſo are hinder'd, from managing, in a becoming Way, the ſeveral Heads of ſevere, but unjuſt Accuſation, which they bring againſt their Adverſary, with an Air of Vanity, and Inſolence. For had'n't he been greatly wanting,

in the pretended Method he obſerves; he wou'd have trac'd the Hiſtory from its very Original, ſince his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention was, to expoſe it to Contempt.

                           <p>Suppoſe any One ſhou'd ſay, there never was ſuch a Scene of Action, as the <hi>Trojan</hi> War, grounding his bold Affirmation, on the ſeeming Impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, of ſome of the material Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, which attended it; and not conceiving, how there ſhou'd be, <hi>In</hi>

                              <hi>rerum natura,</hi> ſuch a Perſon, as <hi>Achilles</hi> is repreſented to us, the Son of <hi>Peleus,</hi> and <hi>Thetis,</hi> the Goddeſs of the Sea; or <hi>Sarpedon,</hi> the Son of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> or <hi>Aſcalaphus,</hi> and <hi>Jalmenus,</hi> the Sons of <hi>Mars;</hi> or <hi>Aeneas,</hi> the Son of <hi>Venus;</hi> how cou'd we convince him of his groſs Miſtake, when ſo many Fables, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing interwoven with the Body of the Hiſtory, are ſo readily, and ſo univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally believ'd? Or ſuppoſe, any Perſon ſhou'd call into Queſtion, the Story of <hi>Oedipus,</hi> and <hi>Jocaſta,</hi> and <hi>Eteocles,</hi> and <hi>Polynices,</hi> their Sons, by reaſon of what is confidently related, concerning the <hi>Sphinx,</hi> a certain Monſter, that was half a Virgin, how cou'd we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate, that the whole Account is true?</p>
                           <p>I might ſay the ſame, concerning the ſecond <hi>Theban</hi> War, which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd, by the Poſterity of them, who had loſt their Lives in the firſt (tho' that be more free from the Appearance of Fiction, than the former Story) and concerning the Return of the <hi>Heraclidae</hi> to <hi>Peloponneſus;</hi> and I might inſtance in many other Things, of the like Nature, which are recorded in the Hiſtories of the <hi>Greeks.</hi> But he who reads 'em, without a Tincture of Prejudice, and with a ſincere Deſire, that he may not be deceiv'd, will judge, how far he is

requir'd, to yield his ready, and firm Aſſent; what Paſſages he muſt take in an Allegorical Sence, and what he muſt reject, as being writ in Favour of ſome particular Perſons, and will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, to find out the true, and full Meaning of thoſe, who were the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Authors of theſe Stories, which the <hi>Greeks,</hi> who are a learned Nation, do ſo generally believe.

And tho' the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſays, <hi>I ſaw the Lord, ſitting upon a Throne, high, and lifted up, above it ſtood</hi>

                              <hi>the Seraphims, each one had ſix Wings;</hi> Pray Sir, what rational Aſſurance have you, that he really ſaw, this enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining, and amazing Sight? You be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that theſe Things are true, and come from the Spirit of God, who nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can be deceiv'd, nor will deceive us, and are perſwaded, not only, that the Prophet ſaw 'em, but alſo that he was Divinely-inſpir'd, when he committed theſe Things to Writing.</p>
                           <p>But I ask, which of theſe three, is it moſt fit we ſhou'd believe, <hi>Ezekiel; Iſaiah,</hi> or our <hi>Bleſſed Saviour?</hi> The two former did nothing, that deſerves to be compar'd, or ev'n mention'd, with

what the latter has done, whoſe Power was not only moſt gloriouſly diſplay'd, when he appear'd, and dwelt on Earth; but ſhines with a happy, and remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable Luſtre, at this Diſtance of Time, in the Converſion, and exemplary Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of thoſe, who believe in God thro' him. And that all thoſe wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Effects, which we frequently ſee, are owing to his infinite Power, I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from hence, that as he ſaid, and, as conſtant Experience may convince us, <hi>the ſincere Labourers are few,</hi> in a <note place="margin">Mat. ix.

                           <p>Perhaps, it may be objected againſt us, <hi>That ev'n they, who have giv'n us an Account, of the Holy Spirit's Appearing in the Reſemblance of a Dove, and of the Voice, that came from Heav'n; hadn't theſe Things, ſo much as from our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's Mouth, ſince, ev'n according to our own Notions, the ſame Spirit, which inſpir'd</hi> Moſes, <hi>to write a Hiſtory of what paſs'd for many Ages, before ever he was born, ev'n from the Creation of the World to the Time of</hi> Abraham, <hi>who, in ſome Sence, was the Father of the</hi> Jewiſh <hi>Race, might alſo immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal the ſtrange Paſſages, which happen'd at our Saviour's Baptiſm, to the four Evangeliſts.</hi>

All therefore, that I ſhall do at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, ſhall be to ſhew, that <hi>Celſus</hi> did not only want the Innocence of the Dove, but ev'n the Subtilty of the Serpent, when he put ſuch Diſcourſe as this, into the Mouth of one, whom he calls a <hi>Jew,</hi> who, if he be not falſe to his Pretenſions, muſt believe ſeveral Things, that are much more impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, than any Thing related in the Hiſtory, of which, I am now diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing.</p>

                           <p>I Remember, in a Diſputation, I had with ſome Celebrated <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Doctors, and before a great Deal of Learned Company, who were at once Witneſſes, and Judges of what I ſaid, I us'd this Argument againſt 'em; Pray Gentlemen, let me know, ſaid I, ſince two Perſons have appear'd, upon the Stage of the World, who are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently reported, to have done ſuch Things, as were vaſtly beyond the Sphere of Nature; <hi>viz. Moſes,</hi> the Lawgiver of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who has writ the Hiſtory of what he did; and
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:60159:77"/>
JESUS, our Maſter, who has not left behind him, in Writing, an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, of any of the Actions which he did; but has the concurring Teſtimony of the four Evangeliſts; I ſay, let me know, on what Grounds, you can juſtify the vaſt Difference, which you make between 'em, that we muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, forſooth, that <hi>Moſes</hi> deliver'd nothing, but what was true, tho' the <hi>Egyptians</hi> reproach him, as one that dealt with the Devil; but muſt look upon our Saviour, as a vile Impoſtour, on the Account of the ſevere Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which you bring againſt him. We ſee, that both theſe Perſons, have their Authority ſupported, by the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of a great Body of People, <hi>Moſes</hi> has his ſupported by the ready, and joint Teſtimony of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and our <hi>Saviour</hi> his by the General Suffrage of the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who don't deny <hi>Moſes,</hi> to be a Prophet ſent from God; but confirm the Hiſtory of our Saviour, ev'n by the Sacred, and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſputed Authority of your celebrated <hi>Moſes.</hi> If therefore, you deſire us, to juſtify our Conduct, in paying ſo awful a Regard to our Bleſſed Saviour, do you firſt aſſign ſome Reaſons, why you believe in <hi>Moſes,</hi> who came into the World, many Ages before the <hi>incarnate Jeſus,</hi> and then, it may be time to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:60159:78" rendition="simple:additions"/>
you, with the <hi>rational</hi> Grounds, on which our Faith is built.</p>
                           <p>But if you refuſe to give us any Reaſons, why you believe in <hi>Moſes,</hi> neither ſhall we think fit to acquaint you, with thoſe we have, for believing in our Saviour, or if you are not able to offer any Demonſtrative Arguments in favour of your juſtly celebrated <hi>Moſes,</hi> be pleas'd to hear, what Arguments we can bring, ev'n from the Law, and the Prophets, to prove, that our Jeſus is the true <hi>Meſſiah.</hi> And which is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſtrange, thoſe very Arguments, which we bring from the Old Teſtament Writings, to prove, that our Saviour had a Divine Commiſſion, do, at the ſame Time, prove, that <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets were Perſons, who were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately inſpir'd. But to return.</p>
                           <p>The Law, and the Prophets, abound, with as ſtrange Stories, as that of the Dove, that appear'd to our Saviour, at his Baptiſm; and the Voice, that came to him out of Heav'n; and that it was the Spirit of God, that appear'd to him, in the Reſemblance of a Dove, do's, I think, at leaſt ſeem highly probable, from the Conſideration of the Miracles, which our Saviour wrought, which <hi>Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> ſays, he did, by the Help of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick, which he had learn'd in <hi>Egypt.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="151" facs="tcp:60159:78"/>
Here I think, it may not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper, to mention, not only the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles of our Saviour; but alſo thoſe, which were wrought by the Apoſtles, who were, every Way, qualify'd, for that great Work, in which, their Maſter did engage 'em. For if their Miniſtry hadn't been accompany'd with Miracles, they wou'd never have been able, ſo happily to prevail with their Hearers, to renounce the Religion, in which they had been born, and bred, and to embrace a new, diſcountenanc'd Doctrine, the Profeſſion of which, wou'd expoſe 'em to the greateſt Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, ev'n to an ignominious, and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Death, and ſome remarkable Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps of that Holy Spirit, who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd to our Saviour, in the Reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of a Dove, do remain among <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> to this very Day. They diſpoſſeſ <hi>Daemons,</hi> perform many won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Cures, and ſometimes, when God ſees fit, they foreſee, and foretel future, diſtant, and very contingent Events. And therefore, let <hi>Celſus,</hi> and his <hi>Jew,</hi> ridicule us, as much as ever they pleaſe, yet 'tis plain, and I think, undeniable, that many Perſons have embrac'd the Chriſtian Religion, in Spite of all the Force of Prejudice, the Spirit of God making ſo ſudden, and ſo powerful an Impreſſion on their Minds, whether in
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:60159:79"/>
a Dream, or Viſion, or ſome other Way, that inſtead of being implacable Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to Chriſtianity, as once they were, they have chearfully, and ev'n trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phantly, laid down their Lives, for the Sake of their Profeſſion, and ſeal'd the Truth with their warmeſt Blood.</p>
                           <p>If I ſhou'd only relate thoſe Things, that have fall'n, within the Compaſs, of my own perſonal Knowledge, and frequent Obſervation; I ſhou'd furniſh Infidels, with abundant Matter of Laughter, who wou'd be ready to ſuſpect us <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> as we do them, of inventing Fictions, to ſupport a bad, and ſinking Cauſe, tho' the Searcher of Hearts can bear me Witneſs, that my Deſign, and Endeavour, is not to maintain our Religion, by fabulous, and ridiculous Narrations; but by a Variety of proper Evidence, to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it to the World, as being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd from no other, than a Divine Original.</p>
                           <p>And ſince 'tis a pretended <hi>Jew,</hi> who calls in Queſtion, the Deſcent of the Holy Spirit, upon our Saviour, in the Reſemblance of a Dove, one might well demand, who is it, that ſays thus in <hi>Iſaiah</hi>'s Prophecy, <hi>Now the Lord God</hi>

                              <pb n="154" facs="tcp:60159:80"/>
The ſame Author, tho' he don't be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that our Saviour was the true Meſſiah, and when he enquires into the Cauſe of the Taking of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the Deſtruction of the Temple, don't aſcribe this grievous, and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing Calamity, as he ought to have done, to the Crucifixion of our Bleſſed Saviour; yet is fore'd: to make ſome ſlender Approach to Truth, and to acknowledge, that 'twas a remarkable Judgment, which God ſent upon the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation, for killing <hi>James</hi> the juſt, (who was Brother to <hi>Jeſus,</hi> who is call'd by the Name of <hi>Chriſt,)</hi> and was, without doubt, a very virtuous, and pious Man.</p>
                           <p>This <hi>James</hi> was the ſame Perſon, St. <hi>Paul,</hi> that ſincere Follower, and eminent Apoſtle of our Bleſſed Lord, tells us, that he went to viſit, becauſe he was the Brother of Chriſt, which Title was proper for him, not ſo much by Reaſon of their being, in a peculiar Sence, of the ſame Fleſh, and Blood, as on the Account of the admirable, and manifeſt Agreement both of their Doctrine, and their Morals.</p>
                           <p>If then the fore-mention'd Author ſays, <q>That the Deſtruction of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> was owing to the Barbarous Death of <hi>James</hi> the juſt;</q> how much more Reaſon is there to believe, 'twas
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:60159:80" rendition="simple:additions"/>
really, and principally owing to the Crucifixion of our Bleſſed Saviour, whoſe Divinity, is ſo frequently at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted, by ſo many large, and united Bodies of Men, that conſiſt of ſuch Perſons, as have left their vicious Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices, devote themſelves to the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of their great Creator, and liberal Benefactor, and in all their Actions, have a moſt ſerious Regard to his Honour, and Intereſt in the World.</p>
                           <p>And tho' the pretended <hi>Jew</hi> ſhou'd make no Apology for the Prophet <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel,</hi> and <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> ſince we meet with Paſſages in their Writings, and in the reſt of the Prophets, which are no leſs ſtrange, I am ſure, than thoſe which are related in the Goſpels, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning our Bleſſed Saviour; <hi>viz.</hi> That the Heavens were open'd, and that he heard a Voice from thence; I ſhall endeavour to ſhew, that all, who believe an over-ruling Providence, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, there have been praeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Viſions, and ſuch wherein fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Events, relating to the Affairs of humane Life, have been more clearly, or more obſcurely repreſented to the warm Imagination; I ſay, I ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to ſhew, that the Aſſertors of Providence acknowledge, that ſuch Viſions have been ſeen, by Perſons in their Sleep; and that 'tis no difficult
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:60159:81"/>
Matter to conceive, upon this <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis,</hi> that the ſame Impreſſions may be made on the Imagination, when a Perſon is awake: Whether they be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd by God, for the private Benefit of ſome particular Perſons, or to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the ſpiritual Advantage of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in general, and as in our Sleep, tho' there be nothing to ſtrike upon our Senſe of Sight, or Hearing, yet we ſtrongly imagine, that we ſee ſuch Objects, and hear ſuch articulate Sounds, when 'tis our rational Faculty, that's all this while at Work, and undergoes theſe various, and ſtrange Senſations<hi>:</hi> So there's no Abſurdity, in ſuppoſing, that the ſame Thing might happen to the Prophets, when we read, that the Heav'ns were open'd to 'em, that they ſaw ſtrange Sights, and heard the Voice of the great God himſelf.</p>
                           <p>For my Part, I don't ſuppoſe, that the viſible Heavens were open'd, and, in a literal Sence, were cleav'd aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to give the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> an Occaſion, for writing as he do's.</p>
                           <p>And I am fully ſatisfy'd, that they who read the Goſpels, with any Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Judgment, won't underſtand our Saviour's Viſion, in the groſs Senſe of the Words of Scripture, tho' I am not a little ſenſible, that the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant Sort of People, who, at every

Turn, and to ſupport an idle Whim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy of their own, will allow the Frame of Univerſal Nature, to be ſhak'd from off its Hinges; and imagine, that ſo vaſt, and compact a Body, as that of the Heavens, was rent in two; will be offended with any Diſcourſe in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, that do's in the leaſt, interfere with the literal, and moſt obvious Sence of Scripture.</p>
                           <p>But one who dives to the Bottom of Things, will find, that, according to the Account, we have, in Holy Writ, there is a certain, Divine Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, which none, but a few, happy Perſons have, (as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſays, <hi>Thou ſhalt find the Knowledge of the Lord)</hi> 
                              <note place="margin">Prov. ii.

The Bleſſed Prophets therefore, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Partakers of theſe Divine Senſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ſeeing, hearing, taſting, and ſmelling, in a Way that is perfectly ſupernatural, we muſt underſtand theſe Things, in the ſame Sence, in which we muſt take that Place in <hi>Ezekiel;</hi> where he's ſaid, to have eat the Book that was deliver'd him.</p>
                           <p>In this Sence it was that <hi>Iſaac</hi> ſmelt the ſweet Savour of the Divine Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his Son, and pronounc'd this Bleſſing upon him, <hi>See the Smell of my Son is as the Smell of a Field, which the Lord has bleſs'd.</hi> And after the ſame Manner, our Saviour touch'd the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, which I think, muſt be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of a Spiritual, rather than a Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real Touch, that he might not only cleanſe him, as ſome think, from his bodily Diſtemper, but chiefly, that he might purge him from the viler, and more dangerous Leproſy of Sin. And after the ſame manner, <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist</hi> bears Witneſs in the following Words, <hi>I ſaw the Spirit deſcending from</hi>

                           <p>GIVE me leave to add one Thing here, and that is this, that <hi>Celſus,</hi> without any Warrant from Scripture, or Reaſon, as far as I can ſee, imagines, that our Saviour did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint his Diſciples, with the ſtrange Things that had happen'd to him, that the Heavens had been open'd, and that the Spirit of God, had deſcended upon him at the River <hi>Jordan.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>But this mighty Man, with all his Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, ſeems not at all to have conſider'd the Incongruity of ſuch a Suppoſition, with the General Practice of our Saviour, who forbad his Diſciples, to make mention of the Viſion, which he ſaw upon the Mountain, 'till he ſhou'd riſe from the Dead. And No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was more common, as appears from the Goſpels, than for our Bleſſed Saviour, to do what lay in his Power to avoid all Talk, that was in favour of himſelf. Therefore he ſays, <hi>If I bear</hi>

<pb n="161" facs="tcp:60159:83"/>
avoided every Thing that ſavour'd of Self-Applauſe, and had rather that his Works ſhou'd praiſe him, and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate to the World, that he was the true <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> ſaid to him, <hi>If thou be the Chriſt, do thou tell us plainly.</hi> And becauſe the <hi>Jew,</hi> whom <hi>Celſus</hi> perſonates, ſpeaking of the Appearance of the Holy Spirit, to our Saviour, in the Reſemblance of a Dove, ſays, <hi>There's no Body, to attest the Truth, of what happen'd to you, beſides your ſelf, and another Perſon, of the ſame pityful Claſs,</hi> I think it will be ſeaſonable, and highly neceſſary, to ſhew, that he talks in ſuch a manner, as is very unſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Character he bears.

I preſume, 'twas for this politick Reaſon, becauſe he knew very well, that he cou'dn't return any tolerable Anſwer to a Propoſition, to which both the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the greateſt Hereticks did aſſent, who all agree, that many of the Prophecies of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Prophets were accompliſh'd, in the Perſon of him, whom we believe to be the True Meſſiah.</p>
                           <p>And perhaps, he had never read the Prophecies, but had heard a general, and looſe Report concerning 'em. For if he had known, that there have been ſeveral Prophets, who have foretold our Saviour's Appearance in the World, certainly he wou'd never have put
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:60159:84" rendition="simple:additions"/>
theſe Words, into the Mouth of a <hi>Jew,</hi> (which I think, wou'd much better have become a <hi>Samaritan;</hi> or a <hi>Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducee,)</hi> viz. <hi>My Prophet ſaid formerly in</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>that the Son of God wou'd come to reward the Righteous, and to puniſh the Wicked.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>For ſurely, there have been more than one Prophet, that have prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy'd of our Bleſſed Saviour, ſince ev'n the <hi>Sadduces,</hi> and the <hi>Samaritans;</hi> who own no more than the <hi>Pentateuch,</hi> can't but ſee, if they are not wilfully blind, that <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſy'd concerning him, and 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, the Prophecy ſhou'd be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſince the Name of no ſuch Place was known, for many Ages after <hi>Moſes.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>By the Way, I wiſh with all my Heart, that all our implacable Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries; unleſs it ſhou'd pleaſe God to convert 'em, were as ignorant as <hi>Celſus,</hi> not only of the true, and full Sence of the Things, of which the Scripture treats; but alſo of the very Letter of it, that ſo their Diſcourſes, not having that Colour of Reaſon, which ſometimes they have, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on People might not ſo much, as for a ſhort Space of Time, yield, ev'n the weakeſt Aſſent to any Thing, they are able to produce againſt us.</p>

Beſides no <hi>Jew,</hi> but one, who is brought over to the Religion which we embrace, will acknowledge, that the Prophets foretold, that the Son of God was to come into the World. What the <hi>Jews</hi> ſay is this, that the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> is to come, and in their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations with us, the firſt Queſtion almoſt which they ask, is, <hi>Who is this Son of God, of whom you talk ſo much?</hi> intimating to us, that they don't be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that any ſuch Perſon was ever intended by the Prophets.</p>
                           <p>For my Part, I firmly believe, that the Perſon, of whom there are ſo many Predictions, in the Writings of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Prophets, is the Son of God; but I can't, for my Life, conceive, how a <hi>Jew,</hi> who denies this plain Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, can conſiſtently with his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, make uſe of the following Words, <hi>My Prophet ſaid formerly in</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>that the Son of God was to come into the World.</hi> Then <hi>Celſus</hi> adds the following Words, <hi>To reward the righteous, and to puniſh the wicked.</hi> And, as if this was all that was fore-told, and there were no Predictions, concerning the Place of our Saviour's Nativity, or the unjuſt, and barbarous Treatment, which he met with, at the Hands of his own Country-men the <hi>Jews,</hi> or his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection from the dead, or the Miracles

he perform'd; he ſays, <hi>Why ſhou'd this Prophecy be appropriated to you, when the ſame Thing may be ſaid of many Perſons, that liv'd before, and after you, with more reaſon, than you can ſay it of your ſelf?</hi> and ſeeming to inſinuate, that there were abundance of Perſons, to whom this Prophecy might fitly be apply'd, as well in all reſpects, as to our Bleſſed Saviour; he ſays, <hi>Several Enthuſiaſts and Impoſtors have claim'd the venerable Title, of the Son of God, and have ſaid, that they came down from Heav'n:</hi> tho' I know not, what Ground he cou'd have, for uſing this Expreſſion, ſince the <hi>Jews</hi> do ſtrongly deny, that our Saviour was the Son of God. To this I anſwer, that ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Prophets have prophecy'd in a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent manner, concerning the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> ſome by obſcure, and almoſt unintelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible Hints, others by Allegories, and ſome in the plaineſt, and moſt expreſs Terms imaginable. And becauſe <hi>Celſus</hi> diſcovers his Malice, and exceſſive Heat, in the Sequel of his Diſcourſe, where the <hi>Jew,</hi> ſpeaking to thoſe of his own Nation, that were converted to the <hi>Chriſtian Faith,</hi> has the Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to ſay, <hi>That the Prophecies which are apply'd to our Saviour, may be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, and much better accommodated;</hi> I think, it may not be improper at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:60159:86" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to inſtance in ſome few of 'em, which are moſt conſiderable. And here let any Perſon employ his utmoſt Skill, I defy him to ſhock the Faith of any judicious, and eſtabliſh'd Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</p>
                           <p>As for the Place of our Saviour's Nativity, 'tis ſaid, <hi>That a Ruler ſhall come forth from</hi> Bethlehem, in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Words, <hi>But thou,</hi> Bethlehem <note place="margin">Mica. v.

                           </p>
                           <p>This Prophecy can't, with any Shew of Reaſon, be apply'd to thoſe <hi>Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſts</hi> and <hi>Impoſtors,</hi> as <hi>Celſus</hi> calls 'em, who ſay, they came down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, unleſs it plainly appears, that they were born at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> or as the Words may be render'd, came forth from <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lehem,</hi> to be Rulers of the People. As for our Saviour's being born at <hi>Bethle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hem,</hi> if any Perſon be diſſatisfy'd with the Prophecy of <hi>Micah,</hi> and the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count which is giv'n by the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, let him only conſider, that the <hi>Cave,</hi> in which he was born, and the <hi>Manger,</hi> in which he lay, are to be ſeen at the fore mention'd Place to this very Day. And this is a Truth ſo well known, and ſo credibly atteſted, that
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:60159:86"/>
ev'n they, who are Strangers to the Chriſtian Religion, are frequently heard to ſay, <hi>Here is the Cave, in which, that</hi> JESUS, <hi>who is worſhip'd by the Chriſtians was born.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>And 'tis my Opinion, that before our Saviour did make his Appearance in the World, the chief Prieſts, and the Teachers of the People, openly confeſs'd, and taught, that the Meſſiah was to be born at <hi>Bethlehem;</hi> and that ev'n the common People among the <hi>Jews</hi> were acquainted with this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, which was deliver'd, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, and very familiar Terms. Hence it came to paſs, that <hi>Herod,</hi> enquiring of the chief Prieſts, and Scribes, where the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> ſhou'd be born, receiv'd this Anſwer, that he ſhou'd be born at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> in the Land of <hi>Judaea,</hi> which was honour'd, by being the Place, from which no leſs a Perſon than King <hi>David</hi> himſelf did ſpring. Beſides we read in St. <hi>John's</hi> Goſpel, <hi>that the</hi> Jews <hi>ſaid, that Chriſt was to be born at</hi> Bethlehem; which was in the Native Country of the fore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd King. But when our Saviour was come into the World, thoſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who left no Stone unturn'd, to oppoſe the Religion, which he intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd, did no longer teach, that the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> was to be born at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi>

                           <p>I thought it neceſſary, to dwell the longer on this Subject, that ſo we may return a ſolid Anſwer, to them, who, perhaps may not ſtick to ſay,

                              <hi>If the Prophecies have ſo plain a reference, to your Saviour, as you ſay they have, how comes it to paſs, that the</hi> Jews, <hi>whoſe Wiſdom you ſo highly value, don't embrace the</hi> Chriſtian Religion, <hi>as well, and as readily as you, and regulate their Practice, by thoſe Precepts, which Chriſt, in ſome Sence, has left behind him?</hi>

                              <note place="margin">Gen. xlix V. 10.</note>

                           </p>
                           <p>This we ſee has been ſo evidently, and ſo remarkably verify'd, that the whole Body of the <hi>Jews,</hi> do take their Name from the fore-mention'd Tribe, which held the Reins of Government in their Hands, and manag'd 'em as

The <hi>Jew</hi> continues his Diſcourſe, in the following Words, <hi>Abundance of Perſons will find Fault, with your pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Saviour, for applying thoſe Prophecies to himſelf, which, they think, may, at leaſt as juſtly, be apply'd to them.</hi> To this I anſwer, that I am apt to think, that <hi>Celſus</hi> didn't know of any Perſons, who rival'd our Saviour, in his Miracles, and juſtly claim'd the Title of <hi>Sons of God,</hi> or <hi>The Power of the Supream Majeſty.</hi> But becauſe the ſincere, and ſtrong Affection, which I have for Truth, won't ſuffer me, to paſs by any Thing, that ev'n ſeems to oppoſe the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Cauſe, I readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acknowledge, that before our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's Incarnation, there was a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Perſon, whoſe Name was <hi>Theudas,</hi> who appear'd among the <hi>Jews,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to be a mighty Man, after whoſe Deceaſe, his deluded Followers were ſoon diſpers'd. Some Time after, in the Days of the Taxing, (during which, as far as I can gather from Scripture, our Bleſſed Saviour was born) one <hi>Judas</hi> of <hi>Galilee,</hi> drew after him, a conſiderable Number of weak, and credulous <hi>Jews,</hi> who, affecting No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velties, cry'd him up, as a Man, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>du'd with more than ordinary Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and was no ſooner brought to condign Puniſhment, but his Doctrine
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:60159:94"/>
came immediately into Diſrepute, or, at beſt, was only ſecretly maintain'd, by ſome few Perſons, of mean Rank, and Figure. And after our Saviour appear'd, upon the Stage of the World, one <hi>Doſitheus,</hi> a <hi>Samaritan,</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd, to perſwade his Country-men, that he was the very Perſon, to whom the Prophets had ſo plain a Reference, when they foretold the Coming of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and ſome few Perſons, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, there were, who ſeem'd heartily to embrace his Doctrine.</p>
                           <p>Here, I think, it will not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper, to mention that wiſe Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> which we meet with, in the Acts of the Apoſtles, to ſhew, beyond all Contradiction, that the fore-mention'd Perſons, were not intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Promiſe, which God gave, of ſending the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of 'em deſerv'd the honourable Title, of <hi>The Son,</hi> or <hi>Power of God;</hi> but that of all the Men, who ever appear'd, and made a Figure in the World, our Bleſſed Saviour was the only Perſon, who cou'd juſtly claim it. <hi>If this Counſel,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>or this Work be</hi>

                              </gap>aw in the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> was the Ground of
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:60159:95" rendition="simple:additions"/>
their ſecret Perſwaſion, that the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> was then born into the World. Let us ſee therefore, what matter of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe this Subject will afford us.</p>
                           <p>I confeſs, 'tis my Opinion, that the Star, that appear'd, at our Saviour's Nativity, was entirely new, and vaſtly different, from thoſe which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſeen, whether in the ſuperiour, or inferiour Orbs, and I am enclin'd to think, it might be much of the ſame kind, with thoſe Comets, that appear for a Time, and have different Names aſſign'd 'em, by the <hi>Greeks,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their different Figure. And I build my Opinion upon the following Grounds. It has been obſerv'd by Learned Authours, that when any conſiderable Alteration has happen'd, in the Face of Affairs, ſuch Stars have expos'd themſelves to View, as did preſage ſome ſtrange Revolutions of Empires, ſome dreadful Wars, or ſome ſuch Accidents as theſe, which put the whole World into a terrible, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual Commotion. I have alſo read, in a Treatiſe concerning Comets, writ by <hi>Chaeremon</hi> the <hi>Stoick,</hi> that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they have preſag'd very happy Events, and he produces ſeveral In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, from very credible Hiſtorians, to make good the Aſſertion, which he there lays down.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="186" facs="tcp:60159:96" rendition="simple:additions"/>
If then, at the Eſtabliſhment of ſome new Monarchy, or before ſome remarkable Scene of publick Affairs do's begin to open, theſe Comets, or Stars of the like Nature, do appear; 'tis no Wonder at all, that a Star ſhou'd be ſeen, at the Nativity of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, who was deſign'd by the All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe God, to make ſo ſudden, ſo great, and ſo happy an Alteration in the World, to publiſh a new, unadorn'd, and diſcountenanc'd Doctrine, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and <hi>Greeks,</hi> but alſo to a vaſt Number of the moſt diſtant, and barbarous Nations of the World.</p>
                           <p>And this I may ſafely ſay, in Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> that we don't meet with any, or at leaſt with no Scripture-Prophecy, concerning the Appearance of ſuch a Star, at ſuch a Time, for Inſtance at the Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſuch a Riſing Empire, but the Star, that grac'd our Saviour's Nativity, was foretold by <hi>Balaam,</hi> as <hi>Moſes</hi> gives us an Account. <hi>There ſhall come,</hi> ſays <note place="margin">Numbers xxiv. v. 17</note> he, <hi>a Star out of</hi> Jacob, <hi>and a Scepter ſhall riſe out of</hi> Iſrael. But here I muſt argue with the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and <hi>Jews,</hi> and therefore ſhall be oblig'd, to diſpute againſt each Sort of Perſons, from very different Topicks. To the <hi>Greeks,</hi> I have this to offer, that the <hi>Magicians,</hi> who converſe with <hi>Daemons,</hi> and do,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:60159:96"/>
with a moſt <hi>Horrid Solemnity,</hi> invoke their ſeaſonable Aſſiſtance, for the moſt part attain the End, which they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to themſelves, unleſs a Divine Power interfere, that is Superiour to the <hi>Daemons,</hi> or ſome Name be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, that has a greater Force, than thoſe Names, which are appropriated by 'em to the Art they practice. But if that ſhou'd happen, then all their <hi>Magical</hi> Operations are unavoidably loſt, and they are, as it were, dazzl'd, and confounded with the bright Rays, of the Sun of Righteouſneſs.</p>
                           <p>It ſeems to me, therefore, to be high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly probable, that when our Saviour was born, and a Multitude of the Heavenly Hoſt (as St. <hi>Luke</hi> do's cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibly relate the Paſſage) prais'd God, ſaying, <hi>Glory to God in the higheſt, Peace on Earth, and good Will towards Men;</hi> 
                              <note place="margin">Luke ii. V. 14.</note> the <hi>Daemons</hi> were ſhock'd, and all their Helliſh Meaſures moſt ſtrangely diſconcerted, not only by good An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, who came down from Heaven, to celebrate the Nativity of our Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour, but alſo by the Humane Soul of the Holy and Spotleſs <hi>Jeſus,</hi> as being a happy Inſtrument of the Deity, which dwelt in ſo glorious, but inconceivable a Manner, ev'n in his Humane Nature. The Wiſe Men, therefore, being deſirous, to perform
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:60159:97"/>
their uſual Operations, and failing in what they endeavour'd to effect, we may naturally ſuppoſe, enquir'd into the Reaſon of their bad Succeſs, and were ſenſible, that ſomething ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary muſt occur, to defeat their rais'd Expectations, and exceed the Power of the <hi>Daemons,</hi> and when they ſaw a Sign in the Heavens, they had a natural Curioſity, to know its Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and having perhaps conſulted the Prophecies of <hi>Balaam,</hi> and this Prophecy of the Star, of which, <hi>Moſes</hi> gives us an Account, and particularly thoſe Words, <hi>I ſhall ſee him, but not now; I ſhall behold</hi> 
                              <note place="margin">Numbers xxiv. V. 17</note> 
                              <hi>him, but not nigh;</hi> from hence they might frame this rational Conjecture, that the very Perſon, at whoſe Birth, 'twas propheſy'd, that a Star ſhou'd appear, was then actually born, and having a juſt Notion, that he was far Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to all their <hi>Daemons,</hi> they came to pay him, the juſt Tribute of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Adoration.</p>
                           <p>They ſteer'd their Courſe, therefore, to <hi>Judaea,</hi> being perſwaded, that ſome great Prince was born, but ignorant of the Nature of his Kingdom, and the Place of his Nativity, and when they were happily come, to the Place where the young Child was; they offer'd Preſents to him, that were live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Repreſentations of his Divine, and

Humane Nature; <hi>viz.</hi> Gold, an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem of his Royal Power, Frankin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe, to note to us his Divinity, and Myrrh, to ſignify his bitter Paſſion.</p>

                           <p>SINCE therefore, 'twas the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of Mankind, that was come into the World, who was God, and by Conſequence, above the Angels; (tho' they are frequently employ'd as miniſtring Spirits, in the Behalf of Men) the Worſhip which the Wiſe-Men paid him, was abundantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compens'd, by the Warning, which the Angel gave 'em, that they ſhou'dn't return to <hi>Herod,</hi> but depart into their own Country another Way.

                              <hi>Jews</hi> was born, and acted unaccoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably, whether his Notion were true or falſe, and was ſo weak, that he didn't diſcern, that either our Saviour was the very Perſon, whom the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets foretold, to be the true <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and ſo wou'd infallibly poſſeſs the Throne; or, on the contrary, was a meer Impoſtor, and by Conſequence, there was no Ground for him, to diſturb the Peace of his Mind, by any jealous Surmiſes.

                           <p>In the mean Time, <hi>Herod</hi> iſſu'd out Orders, that all the Infants, that were in <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> from two Years old, and under, ſhou'd immediately be put to Death, expecting that he, who was born King of the <hi>Jews,</hi> wou'd ſhare

in the ſame common, and approaching Calamity.</p>
                           <p>For he didn't diſcern that inviſible, and kind Hand of Providence, that takes Care of them, who are the proper Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of its moſt watchful Protection, and upon whoſe Safety, the Good of Mankind does ſo evidently, and ſo greatly depend, and among which ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Number, our Bleſſed Saviour deſerves to be eſteem'd the Chief, as being one, who vaſtly, and indeed, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely ſurpaſs'd all other Men, in real, and intrinſick Dignity.</p>
                           <p>For he was not ſent into the World, to be an Earthly King, as <hi>Herod</hi> falſly imagin'd; but to enter on the Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſuch a Glorious Kingdom, as it became the Great God to beſtow, on one, who was to procure a Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for his Subjects, that conſiſts not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely, or chiefly, in Things, which are in themſelves indifferent, and frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prove pernicious to the Owners, and was to govern 'em by ſuch Laws, as are truly Divine, and ſo to take the moſt proper Methods, to render 'em com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly, and for ever happy.</p>
                           <p>Therefore denying, that he was an Earthly King, and ſhewing, that his Kingdom was of a ſpiritual Nature, he ſays, <hi>If my Kingdom were of this</hi>

Let me therefore examine, what he ſays, and return him ſuch an Anſwer, as I judge convenient. 'Tis plain then to thoſe, who read the Goſpels, with any tolerable Care, (which I'm apt to think, my bold, but blundering Antagoniſt never did) that our Saviour choſe twelve Apoſtles, and that there was but one <hi>Publican</hi> among 'em, I mean St. <hi>Mathew;</hi> and by <hi>Mariners,</hi> as he promiſcuouſly calls 'em, I ſuppoſe, he may mean <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> becauſe they left their Father <hi>Zebedee,</hi> to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their Bleſſed Lord. For as for <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Andrew,</hi> that got their Livelyhood by their Nets, they were not ſo properly Mariners, as Fiſhermen, as the Scripture calls 'em.</p>
                           <p>We'll alſo ſuppoſe, that <hi>Levi</hi> the <hi>Publican</hi> was another, to whom he might have a Reference, tho' accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to ſome Copies, that we have of St. <hi>Mark</hi>'s Goſpel, he was no Apoſtle.</p>
                           <p>As for the reſt of that honourable Fraternity, we know not what Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments they were, by which they got their Maintenance, before they eſpous'd the Intereſt of our Bleſſed Saviour.</p>

                           <p>SO that I may ſafely ſay, that 'tis plain to them, who examine into theſe Matters, with that Judgment, Care, and Impartiality, which is highly requiſite, that the Apoſtles were acted by an extraordinary, and ſuper-natural Power, when they publiſh'd the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion</hi> to the World, and made the carnal, and haughty Minds, of ſome of the worſt of Men, ſubmit to the commanding Authority of the Word of God.</p>
                           <p>For this wonderful Effect was not owing to the Charms of humane Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, the Exactneſs of their Method, or thoſe other Artifices, with which the Logick, and Rhetorick of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> do frequently, and perhaps, more than ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently, furniſh too many ſubtil, and deſigning Perſons.</p>
                           <p>I am of the Opinion, I confeſs, that if we cou'd ſuppoſe our Saviour, to have made Choice of Perſons, qualify'd with the brighteſt humane Accompliſhments,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:60159:101"/>
to preach the Goſpel, ſuch as had the general Character, and Reputation, of Men of profound Wiſdom, and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Learning, who, by the Help of ſublime Speculations, polite Language, and a graceful Elocution, cou'd win upon the Audience, and make the ſeveral Paſſions of their Hearers, ſerve their ſordid, and vain-glorious Purpoſes, I ſay, if our Saviour had tak'n this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, he might juſtly have been blam'd, for uſing the ſame carnal Policy, that was too apparent, in the Heads of the ſeveral Sects of Philoſophers, and his Doctrine wou'd have wanted thoſe legible Characters of its Divinity, which were ſtamp'd upon it, had it been maintain'd by ſprightly Fancy, proper, and elegant Language, and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious Cadencies, and the Aſſent giv'n to it, wou'd too nearly have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembl'd that, which is giv'n to the Opinions of the Philoſophers among the <hi>Pagans,</hi> and wou'd manifeſtly have had its Foundation laid in the <hi>Wiſdom of Men,</hi> rather than the irreſiſtible <hi>Power of God.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Now what Perſon, who looks on theſe <hi>Fiſher-men</hi> and <hi>Publicans,</hi> who were not ſo much as taught, the very firſt Principles of Humane Literature, (as the Goſpels acquaint us, and as <hi>Celſus</hi> is ready enough to believe) and
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:60159:101"/>
yet had ſuch a Preſence of Mind, that they were able, not only to diſcourſe to their Country-men the <hi>Jews,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Faith in Chriſt, but alſo to preach the ſame Doctrine to other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and were favour'd with moſt wonderful Succeſs, I ſay, what Perſon who looks on theſe <hi>Fiſhermen</hi> and <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans,</hi> will not preſently enquire, whence they deriv'd this uncommon Power of Perſwaſion, and acknowledge, that our Saviour's Promiſe in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Words, <hi>Come after me, and I will make you Fiſhers of Men;</hi> was evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, <note place="margin">Mat. iv.

                           <p>'Twas this, to which, St. <hi>Paul</hi> has ſo plain a Reference, when he ſays, <hi>My Speech, aad my Preaching was not</hi> 
                              <note place="margin">1 Cor. ii. V. 4.</note> 
                              <hi>with enticing Words of Man's Wiſdom; but in Demonſtration of the Spirit, and of Power, that your Faith ſhou'dn't ſtand in the Wiſdom of Men, but in the Power of God.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>For as the Prophetical Pſalmiſt ſpeaks, who fore-told the Preaching of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, <hi>The Lord gave the Word, great was the Company of thoſe that publiſh'd it;</hi> 
                              <note place="margin">Pſ. lxviii. V. 11.</note> and as it is fore-told in another Place, <hi>His Word runs very ſwiftly.</hi>

We ſee, that <hi>The Voice of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles was heard thro' all the Earth,</hi> and their Doctrine, and Fame too, was ſpread to the moſt diſtant Regions. They alſo, who hear this Doctrine, are fill'd with the Spirit of God, who accompanies the Preaching of it, as abundantly appears, by the Diſpoſition of their Minds, the Tenor of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations, and their vigorous Defence of the naked Truth, ev'n to the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent Hazard of their Fortunes, their Reputations, and their Lives, tho' it can't be deny'd, but ought to be deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lamented, that too many who have tak'n upon 'em the <hi>Miniſterial Function,</hi> after all the Profeſſion, which they make, of believing in God, thro' Chriſt, and after having ſeem'd to be wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully attracted by the bright, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt irreſiſtible Charms of Goſpel-Grace, 'tis to be fear'd, did never feel the ſaving Impreſſion of it on their Hearts, attended with a ſuitable Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence on their Lives, and Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                           <p>And tho' I have already mention'd that Expreſſion in the Goſpel, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to St. <hi>Mathew, The Harveſt is great, but the Labourers are few. Pray ye therefore the Lord of the Harveſt, that he wou'd ſend forth more Labourers into</hi>

<pb n="199" facs="tcp:60159:102" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to repeat it, to ſhew, that our Saviour's Foreknowledge of the Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, which his Doctrine wou'd meet with in the World, was a Divine Proof of its future, happy, and more than ordinary Effect upon the Minds of Men; a Doctrine, the good Succeſs of which was far from depending on the Aſſiſtance of the moſt Learned Doctors, but was owing to that <hi>Divine, and Miraculous Power,</hi> that accompany'd the Apoſtles in their SACRED MINISTRATIONS.</p>

                           <p>If they, who have reform'd their Manners, muſt be upbraided with the Crimes, which they formerly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, then we may as well bring in a moſt heavy Charge againſt <hi>Phaedon</hi> himſelf, ev'n after he had devoted his Time, and Strength, to the Study of Philoſophy, becauſe Hiſtory acquaints us, that <hi>Socrates</hi> took him, from a Place, where Debauchery was pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctic'd, without Fear, or Regret, and put him upon rational, and learned
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:60159:104"/>
Studies, in which, in Proceſs of Time, he was far from being a mean Profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient.</p>
                           <p>We might alſo condemn Philoſophy, it ſelf, by Reaſon of the extravagant Courſes, which <hi>Polemon</hi> the Succeſſor of <hi>Zenocrates</hi> had formerly tak'n.

                           <p>And I ſcarce know, whether the <hi>Greeks</hi> can produce any Inſtances of this kind, in any other Perſons, beſides <hi>Phaedon</hi> and <hi>Polemon,</hi> or at beſt, they can name but very few Perſons, who ever left their Intemperance and Debauchery to apply their Minds, to the entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and uſeful Study of Philoſophy.</p>

                           <p>'Twas more agreeable to the Dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates of Infinite Wiſdom, that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſhou'd be carry'd by his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and that he ſhou'd tarry there, 'till they heard of the Death of <hi>Herod,</hi> than that he ſhou'd ſtay in his Native Country, and yet be preſerv'd, from the Evils to which he was expos'd, being better arm'd than with <hi>Pluto</hi>'s <hi>Helmet,</hi> and ſecur'd from the Rage of his malicious Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, by their being ſtruck, like the <hi>Sodomites</hi> of old, with ſudden Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.

this general, and neceſſary Rule, that the Scripture, when it ſpeaks of God, do's often cloath him, as it were, with thoſe very Paſſions, which are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently working in Humane Breaſts.</p>
                           <p>But to what Purpoſe is it, to return an Anſwer, to a Perſon, who ev'n in a Diſcourſe, Entitul'd, <hi>A True Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> takes the Liberty, to give Vent to his Paſſion, in moſt unjuſt, and ſevere Invectives, and to treat our <hi>Bleſſed Saviour,</hi> as if he were, like him, a Notorious, and Vile Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtor.</p>
                           <p>For ſuch Language, as he gives him, don't become a Man, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and <hi>Demonſtration,</hi> tho' he diſcovers at once, his Want both of Sence, and Breeding.

And I confeſs, I can't but wonder, that ſince <hi>Celſus</hi> was ſo fond of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Perſon of a <hi>Jew,</hi> he didn't make him direct his Diſcourſe to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> rather than to his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-men.

But it ſeems, this mighty Man, with all his Knowledge, to which he makes ſuch great Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, did not know, or at leaſt, do's ſeem to me, not duely to conſider, the Nature of that Figure of Speech, which we make uſe of, when we ſpeak in the Perſon of another.</p>
                           <p>Let us ſee therefore, what he ſays, to thoſe <hi>Jews,</hi> who embrac'd the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion. He ſays, <hi>That ſuff'ring themſelves, to be most ſhamefully deluded by our Saviour, they left the Religion of their Ancestors, and alter'd both their Name, and their Courſe of Life.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>But he don't conſider, that the <hi>Jews,</hi> who believ'd in our <hi>Bleſſed Saviour,</hi> did not totally renounce the Law of their juſtly-admir'd Progenitors, and Fore-Fathers; but liv'd in the Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of it, deriving their Appellation, from a Word, that denotes the Poverty of the meer Letter of the Law.</p>

their Courſe to the Circumciſion. But need I ſay, that they who preach'd to the <hi>Jews</hi> withdrew, and ſeparated themſelves from the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> when the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf became a <hi>Jew</hi> to the <hi>Jews,</hi> that he might win upon 'em.

                           <p>Had <hi>Celſus</hi> known all this, he wou'd never have introduc'd a <hi>Jew,</hi> addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing himſelf to thoſe, who were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted from <hi>Judaiſm</hi> to the Chriſtian Faith, in the following Manner. <hi>What is the Matter,</hi> ſays he, <hi>my dearly beloved Country-men, that you have on a ſudden renounc'd the Religion of your Fathers, and Anceſtors, and ſuffer'd your ſelves to be ſo ſhamefully deluded by your pretended Saviour, as to be prevail'd with to alter your Name, and Courſe of Life.</hi>

which our Saviour made to his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, was abundantly, fulfill'd to the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> when the Spirit of God ſhew'd him in a Viſion, all Sorts of Animals, Birds, and Four-footed Beaſts, and creeping Things, and ſaid to him, <hi>Riſe,</hi> Peter, <hi>kill, and eat.</hi> And indeed, at that Juncture of Time, he was ſo fond of his former Religion, that he return'd this Anſwer, ev'n to the Voice, which he heard from Heaven, <hi>Not ſo Lord, for I have never eaten any Thing, that is common, or unclean.</hi> But at length, his Underſtanding was enlighten'd, as appears from the following Words, <hi>What God has cleans'd call not thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</hi>

Others of you are great Admirers of a ſpiritual Sence, as you are pleas'd to term it, and yet are diligent Obſervers of thoſe outward Ceremonies, which make ſo conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable a Part of the Religion which we embrace. There remain ſome others, who adhere to the literal Sence of Scripture, thinking, that Abundance of ſpiritual Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is wrapt up, in the very Letter of the Law, and profeſs, that</hi> Jeſus <hi>of</hi> Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth <hi>was the Perſon, who was foretold by the</hi> Jewiſh <hi>Prophets, and at the ſame Time, obſerve the Precepts of</hi> Moſes, <hi>and the Traditions of their Anceſtors.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>But how cou'd it be expected, that <hi>Celſus</hi>'s <hi>Jew,</hi> ſhou'd give us a true, and clear Account of Matters of this Nature, ſince in the Sequel of his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,

he mentions ſeveral very great, and notorious Hereſies.

                           <p>For his Deſign was not, to act the Part of an impartial Enquirer into Truth, who readily ſubmits to the Evidence, which it carries with it, but to vent his Malice, and right, or wrong, to make a Vigorous Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Chriſtian Religion, and as he vainly thought, to expoſe it to the higheſt Contempt imaginable.</p>

But to this I have already return'd a ſufficient Anſwer.

                           <p>THEN the pretended <hi>Jew</hi> tells us, <hi>That our Saviour was puniſh'd by his own Country-men, according to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merit of his horrid Crimes.</hi> But I think, I have ſaid enough already, in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to ſo pityful a Cavil, and therefore, ſha'n't do him the Honour, to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate him, in his frequent, and needleſs Repetitions.</p>
                           <p>Then he laughs at the Doctrine of the Reſurrection, and of a Future Judgment, at which the Righteous will be rewarded, and the Wicked puniſh'd; I ſay, he laughs at it, as being, in his Opinion, moſt highly ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous. And he ſays, <hi>That the</hi> Chriſtians <hi>ſay nothing, ev'n on theſe important Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, as they are pleas'd to call 'em, but what was ſaid long before;</hi> imagining, that this is an effectual Argument, to overthrow the whole Superſtructure of Chriſtianity.</p>

                              <pb n="18" facs="tcp:60159:124"/>
To this I anſwer, that our Bleſſed Saviour, perceiving how little Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity there was, between the Lives of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the Doctrines, ev'n of their own Celebrated Prophets, thought fit to teach 'em, by Parables, <hi>that the Kingdom of God ſhou'd be</hi> 
                              <note place="margin">Mat. xxi. V. 41.</note> 
                              <hi>tak'n from 'em, and giv'n to the</hi> Gentiles.</p>
                           <p>And we ſee this Prophecy, moſt evidently, and remarkably fulfill'd, in the Age, in which we live. For the preſent <hi>Jews,</hi> not enjoying the Benefit, of that ſupernatural Light, which is highly neceſſary, to the right Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the Scriptures, abound, to their great Shame, with extravagant, and innumerable Fancies<hi>:</hi> Whereas the Chriſtians are happily led, into the Spiritual Knowledge of the Truth, which alone is able, at once, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten, and elevate the Mind, and don't live after the Manner of the <hi>Jews,</hi> as Members, of an Earthly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick, but like worthy, and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Citizens of that Heavenly <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> of which their Pompous Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and external Grandeur, is a very imperfect Emblem.</p>
                           <p>This is evident, in as much as they penetrate, into the deep Myſteries of the Law, and are able, to give a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, and intelligible Explication of 'em, to any Perſons, who may modeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſire it.</p>

And ſuppoſe I ſhou'd grant, that our Saviour himſelf went ſo far, as to obſerve the various Ceremonies, relating to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Sacrifices, this I think, wou'd be no ſolid Argument, againſt our believing, that he was the <hi>SON</hi> of <hi>GOD.</hi>

                           </p>
                           <p>I anſwer, let him inſtance in any one Perſon, if he can, who ever gave ſuch uſeful Precepts to the World, as our Bleſſed Saviour has left upon Record, and taught 'em a Doctrine, which had as great a Virtue, to reform the Manners of Men, as that which accompany'd the ſucceſsful Preaching of the Goſpel.</p>
                           <p>Then he ſays, the Chriſtians <hi>find Fault with the</hi> Jews, <hi>for not believing, that Chriſt was God.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>But this I have already anſwer'd, and ſhew'd, in what Reſpects, we own our Saviour to be <hi>GOD,</hi> and in what Sence, we believe he was a <hi>Real Man.</hi>

                              <hi>CELS<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S</hi>'s <hi>Jew</hi> adds the following Words, <hi>How can any one imagine, that we, who all along declar'd to the World, that God wou'd ſend a Perſon, to puniſh the diſobedient, and rebellious, ſhou'd treat him ſo baſely, when he came, in Compliance with the Will of God, and to accompliſh ſuch great Deſigns.</hi> But 'tis hardly worth my while, to return an Anſwer, to ſo ridiculous a Queſtion.</p>
                           <p>For 'tis juſt as if a Perſon ſhou'd ſay, how is it poſſible, that I, who always preach'd up the Doctrine of Temperance, ſhou'd be guilty of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery, or, that I, who in Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, did always vindicate the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd Rights of Juſtice, ſhou'd ever be guilty, of violating its Sacred Rules? And as nothing is more common, than for Perſons to talk, in the Praiſe of Virtue, and yet be openly guilty, of the moſt ſcandalous Vices: So the <hi>Jews,</hi> who make the Prophetick Oracles the Matter of their continual Boaſt, do yet ſhut their Eyes, againſt the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60159:127"/>
glorious Light, of thoſe Scripture-Prophecies, which are evidently ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh'd, in the Perſon of our Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour. And if I may aſcribe their Blindneſs, to ſome other Cauſe, beſides the wretched Degeneracy of Humane Nature, which they plainly diſcover'd, I may ſafely ſay, that 'twas directly foretold, by the very Prophets they ſo much admire.</p>
                           <p>For <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſays expreſly, <hi>Hear ye in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed but understand not, and ſee ye indeed, but perceive not, make the Heart of this People fat.</hi> Now let any Perſon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint me, what it is, that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet intends, by theſe, and the like Expreſſions. 'Tis plain, they ſaw our Saviour, but wilfully ſhut their Eyes, againſt the piercing Rays of the <hi>S<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>N</hi> of <hi>RIGHTEO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>SNESS,</hi> and heard him diſcourſe to 'em, but cou'dn't com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, that his humane Nature was the living Temple of the Deity, which was going to forſake their Nation, and to engage all its infinite Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, in the behalf of the believing <hi>Gentiles.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>And 'tis Matter of Fact, and a Thing very Remarkable, that ſince the Incarnation of our Bleſſed Saviour, the <hi>Jews</hi> have been left by God, and that the Beauty, and Glory of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, is, in a Manner, entirely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fac'd
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:60159:127"/>
and loſt, inſomuch that there is ſcarce one Sign of the Divine Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence among 'em, except the ſevere Judgments, which do ſo juſtly befall their Nation.</p>
                           <p>They have neither Prophets, nor Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, to atteſt the Truth of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, whereas the Chriſtians, ev'n at this Diſtance of Time, have a Power of working Miracles, conferr'd upon 'em, ſome of which are not infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to thoſe, which were wrought, when our Saviour was on Earth.</p>

                           <p>THEN <hi>Celſus</hi>'s <hi>Jew</hi> breaks out into the following Expreſſion, <hi>How can any one imagine, that we ſhou'd treat a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſo ill, that was foretold by our own Prophets, unleſs we had a Mind to enhance our Crime, and ſo to aggravate our moſt deſerved Puniſhment?</hi>

                           <p>To this, I anſwer, that at the final Judgment (which is one of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the <hi>Chriſtian Faith)</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> will be puniſh'd, in a more dreadful Manner, than the reſt of the World,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:60159:128"/>
not only for rejecting the Meſſiah, which was a horrid Crime, but alſo for their barbarous, and almoſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable Carriage, towards the Prince of Peace.</p>

                           <p>THE <hi>Jew</hi> adds, <hi>How cou'd we look upon him as</hi> GOD, <hi>who on the one Hand, did none of thoſe Mighty Things, which he pretended to effect, and on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, was convicted, and condemn'd to a ſevere Puniſhment, was forc'd to abſcond, that he might not be taken, running, like a Vagabond, from Place to Place, and yet was at laſt apprehended, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd, ev'n by one of his most eminent Followers, who of all Perſons in the World, one wou'd think, might have had the Grace, to eſpouſe his Maſter's Cauſe?

                           <p>To this I anſwer, that we are not ſo ignorant, as to call <hi>THE BODY</hi> of our <hi>Bleſſed Saviour,</hi> which was material, and ſenſible, by the <hi>VENERABLE NAME</hi> of GOD. Nay, we don't attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute

                           <p>After the ſame Manner, we ſay, that it was <hi>GOD,</hi> the <hi>ETERNAL WORD,</hi> the <hi>SON</hi> of the <hi>EVER-BLESSED GOD,</hi> that made Uſe of the humane Nature of the <hi>HOLY JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S,</hi> as a proper Inſtrument, when he ſpoke the following Words, <hi>I am the Way, the</hi>

                              <pb n="29" facs="tcp:60159:129"/>
We blame the <hi>Jews</hi> therefore, and I think not unjuſtly, for not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging our Saviour to be God, of whom the Prophets do ſo frequently produce their concurring Teſtimony, that he is the <hi>POWER</hi> of the <hi>ETERNAL FATHER.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>'Twas to him the Command of God was directed, which we read of, in the Account that <hi>Moſes</hi> gives us, of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion of the World, <hi>Let there be Light,</hi>

                           <p>And this is not a Conjecture, form'd in our own Fancies, but we build our Faith, in this important Affair, on the concurring Teſtimony, of thoſe very Prophets, who are readily own'd, and extreamly admir'd by the <hi>Jews</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.

                           <p>BESIDES 'tis plain, from ſeveral Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages in the Goſpels, that he, who ſpoke thoſe Words, by the Mouth of the <hi>Bleſſed Jeſus, I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life;</hi> was not circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd, within the narrow Limits of his Humane Nature.</p>

                              <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> foretelling, that in a ſhort Time, the Son of GOD ſhou'd make his Appearance in the World, ſpeaks of him, as a Perſon, that was Omnipreſent. <hi>There ſtands one among</hi>

                           <p>Now is it probable, or ev'n poſſible, he ſhou'd apply theſe Words, to our Saviour's Body, or his Humane Soul?

                           <p>For if St. <hi>Paul</hi> teaches us, that <hi>He that is joyn'd to the Lord is one Spirit,</hi> 
                              <note place="margin">1. Cor. 6.

And our <hi>Bleſſed Saviour</hi> did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly diſcover, that he was no leſs than the Power of God, by the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, and unconteſted Miracles, which he wrought, ev'n in the Preſence of the <hi>Jews,</hi> tho' they profeſs'd, to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a moſt unaccountable Notion, (I can't imagine, for my Part, that it ſhou'd ever enter into any Man's Mind) that he caſt out Devils, by <hi>Beelzebub</hi> the <hi>Prince of the Devils,</hi> and <hi>Celſus,</hi> we know, aſcribes 'em to the Power of Magick.</p>
                           <p>But our Saviour abundantly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed this Abſurd Conceit, by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the Kingdom of <hi>Satan</hi> was
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:60159:131" rendition="simple:additions"/>

                           <p>Let <hi>Celſus</hi> ſhew, if he can, wherein our Saviour fail'd in his great Deſign, to deſtroy the Works of the Devil, and bring convincing Proofs of the Truth, or ev'n Probability of what he offers. But this, I'm apt to think, is what he will ſcarce be able to perform, ſince the Objections, that he raiſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, are founded, for the moſt Part, on ſome Matters of Fact, which are groſly miſunderſtood by him, or ſome Paſſages in the Goſpels, which are ſhamefully miſapply'd, or ſome fabulous Accounts, which are owing to the unhappy, but fruitful Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Jews.</hi>

                              <hi>God, and to build it in three Days.</hi> 'Tis true indeed, he ſpoke theſe Words, of the Temple of his Body, but they, not knowing his Deſign, imagin'd, that they had a Reference to their <hi>Material and Pompous Temple,</hi> for which they plainly diſcover'd a far greater Veneration, than for that <hi>Glorious, and Adorable Temple,</hi> wherein the <hi>ETER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NAL WORD,</hi> the <hi>TR<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>TH,</hi> and <hi>WISDOM</hi> of <hi>GOD</hi> did <hi>Perſonally,</hi> tho' Myſteriouſly reſide.</p>

                           <p>Now if any Perſon ſhou'd be ſo weak, as to imagine, that theſe are only Ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Evangeliſts, have we not Reaſon, on the contrary, to think, our Adverſaries have been groſly guilty of that Practice (with which they charge the Chriſtians) that ſo they might vent their implacable Malice, againſt all thoſe, who profeſs to be the Followers of the <hi>Bleſſed Jeſus,</hi> and to believe, that thoſe Things are moſt certainly true, which are related by Perſons, whoſe Integrity do's abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly appear, from the Conſideration of the dreadful Calamities, to which they knew their Religion did ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly expoſe 'em?</p>
                           <p>For we can't conceive, that the Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of our <hi>Bleſſed Saviour</hi> ſhou'd embrace the moſt ſhameful, and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Death, with undaunted Courage, and heroick Conſtancy, had they been the ſcandalous Inventers of the Hiſtory, which they tranſmitted to Poſterity, but on the contrary, we muſt eſteem 'em to be Perſons, who were fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, in their own Minds, of the Truth, and Importance, of what they publiſh'd to the World; ſince they

                           </p>
                           <p>We have Reaſon therefore to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that our Saviour's moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and awakening Diſcourſes had made ſome faint Impreſſion, ev'n up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Mind of one, who was ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountably ſway'd by a covetous Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, that he had the Impudence to betray his Lord, and wou'd not ſtop, 'till he had ſhamefully compleated the moſt villanous Deſign, for the Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of which, all the Devils in Hell did ever lend their Aſſiſtance. Therefore the Evangeliſt tells us, that Judas <hi>when he ſaw he was condemn'd,</hi> 
                              <note place="margin">Mat xxvi V. 3.</note> 
                              <hi>repented himſelf, and brought again the thirty Pieces of Silver, to the Chief Prieſts and Elders, ſaying I have ſinn'd, in that I have betray'd the innocent Blood. And they ſaid, What's that to us? See thou to that, and he caſt down the Pieces of Silver in the Temple, and departed, and went, and hang'd himſelf.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Now if <hi>Judas,</hi> whoſe Cuſtom we may ſuppoſe it was, to apply to his private Uſe, the Money that was col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:60159:134"/>
for the Relief of the Poor, was ſo far penitent at laſt, as to return the thirty Pieces of Silver, to the Chief Prieſts, and Elders; I think, we may rationally conclude, that the Inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our <hi>Bleſſed Saviour</hi> had wrought, in ſome Meaſure, on this <hi>moſt harden'd Wretch,</hi> that he cou'dn't eraſe 'em, out of his faithful Memory, and fail entirely in his Reſpect for the <hi>meek,</hi> and <hi>ſpotleſs Jeſus.</hi> But thoſe Words, <hi>I have ſinn'd in that I have betray'd the innocent Blood,</hi> are a plain, and open Acknowledgment of his hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid Crime, and you may partly judge, what a lively Senſe he had, of the great Injuſtice, and Ingratitude, that appear'd in what he had ſo lately done, ſince Life it ſelf was grown a Burthen to him, he felt an <hi>unuſual Horror</hi> of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and was forc'd to arraign, accuſe, and condemn himſelf.</p>
                           <p>We have here likewiſe a remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and ſtanding Inſtance, of the happy Effect, which our Saviour's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions had, upon the <hi>vileſt Wretch,</hi> that ever breath'd in the common Air, that tho' he added <hi>the Worſt of Treaſons,</hi> to his Cheating the Poor; yet ſome Sparks of Ingenuity were remaining, in a Perſon, who was little better than a <hi>Devil</hi> in an Humane Form.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="39" facs="tcp:60159:134"/>
Indeed 'tis poſſible, after all I have ſaid, that <hi>Celſus</hi>'s <hi>Jew</hi> may give no Credit, to the Account, which we have in the Goſpels, of the <hi>Treachery</hi> of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi> and will hearken to that Part alone, that acquaints us, that one of our Saviour's Diſciples did betray him, and will take the Liberty, to ſay more than the Holy Scripture do's affirm, <hi>viz.</hi> That he committed that horrid Crime, with the full Bent of his Will, and without the leaſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe.</p>
                           <p>But 'tis very unreaſonable, that a Perſon ſhou'd believe, or disbelieve the Scripture-Hiſtory, as he is led aſide, by the unhappy Biaſs of his deprav'd Affections.</p>
                           <p>And our Adverſaries themſelves, if they have any Shame in 'em, muſt, I think, in ſome Meaſure, be affected, if they will but read the Hundred and Ninth Pſalm, which directly, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely relates to <hi>Judas.</hi> It begins after the following Manner, <hi>Hold not thy</hi>

                           <p>What relates to his being appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by his Enemies, has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready conſider'd, and I have ſhew'd, that he made a <hi>willing Surrender</hi> of himſelf, into the Hands of thoſe Blood-thirſty Wretches, to ſet us a <hi>Bright Example</hi> of Submiſſion to the Will of God, under the <hi>darkeſt Diſpenſations</hi> of his wiſe, and holy Providence.</p>
                           <p>What the <hi>Jew</hi> adds, I confeſs, do's ſeem to me to be very childiſh, and ridiculous. <hi>A good General,</hi> ſays he, <hi>who commands a numerous, and well-diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplin'd Army, was never known to be betray'd by his Soldiers.

But as for your</hi> Pretended Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, <hi>he was betray'd by his</hi> own Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, <hi>not having ſo great an Intereſt in 'em, as a good General in his Soldiers, or the Ring-Leader of a Company of High-way-Men in his vile Accomplices.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>On the contrary, many Inſtances might be produc'd from Hiſtory, of Famous Generals, and Ring-Leaders of High-way-Men, betray'd by thoſe, who were under their Command, ev'n after they had receiv'd from 'em, all the Aſſurances of their inviolable Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity, which they cou'd reaſonably deſire.</p>
                           <p>But ſuppoſe 'twere otherwiſe, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to common Sence, whether it cou'd be faſten'd on our <hi>Bleſſed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,</hi> as a juſt Reproach, that he was ſhamefully betray'd by one, who was engag'd, by all the Sacred Ties of Duty, and Gratitude, to be devoted to his Service, who certainly, if he hadn't been <hi>poſſeſs'd by the Devil,</hi> cou'd never have form'd ſo curſed a Deſign, much leſs have ever brought it to ſo diſhonourable an Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>

                              <pb n="42" facs="tcp:60159:136"/>
I ask <hi>Celſus,</hi> who pretends to no mean Skill in Philoſophy, whether 'twas <hi>Plato</hi>'s Fault, that <hi>Aristotle,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had been his Pupil, for twenty Years, did publickly declare, that he rejected his Tutor's Notion, of the <hi>Immortality of the Soul,</hi> and eſteem'd his Conceptions, as no better than Philoſophical Chimera's, and vain Amuſements.</p>
                           <p>I ask him, whether <hi>Plato</hi>'s Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy loſt any of its native Sublimity, and all his Notions were falſe, the very Moment his Pupil did oppoſe him; or rather, ſince <hi>Plato</hi> was plainly in the right, at leaſt in the Opinion of a <hi>Platoniſt,</hi> whether <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> as Learned as he was, didn't diſcover too much of Malice, and Ingratitude.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Chryſippus</hi> alſo, in ſeveral Places in his Writings, do's condemn the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of <hi>Cleanthes,</hi> tho' 'twas owing to him, that in his younger Years, his Mind was ſeaſon'd, with whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and excellent Inſtructions.</p>
                           <p>Beſides, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> is ſuppos'd to have ſtudy'd Philoſophy in the School of <hi>Plato,</hi> for twenty Years, and <hi>Chryſippus</hi> ſtudy'd the ſame <hi>excellent Science</hi> for many Years, in the School of <hi>Clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes:</hi> Whereas <hi>Judas</hi> hadn't conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu'd three Years with our <hi>Bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,</hi> when he ſo ſhamefully betray'd him.</p>

And if we read the Lives of the Philoſophers, we ſhall meet with fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Inſtances, that, in ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, reſemble the <hi>Horrid Treachery</hi> of <hi>Judas.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>We ſhall find, that the <hi>Pythagoreans</hi> built Tombs, for ſuch Perſons as left the Study of Philoſophy, and betook themſelves to a different, and leſs-uſeful Courſe of Life.</p>
                           <p>But I ſuppoſe no Perſon, will be ſo weak, as to take Occaſion from hence, to reflect on the Doctrine of <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras,</hi> or the ſolid Arguments which his Followers us'd in its Defence.</p>

                           <p>THEN <hi>Celſus</hi> finds Fault with our Saviour's Diſciples, for ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>That he foreknew, and foretold all the remarkable Things that ever happen'd to him.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>But we doubt not in the leaſt, but we can eaſily prove, by an Enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Particulars, (let <hi>Celſus</hi> ſay what he pleaſes to the contrary) that our <hi>Saviour</hi> foretold ſeveral Things, that ſhou'd befall his Diſciples, ſome conſiderable Time before they came to paſs.</p>
                           <p>What a wonderful Inſtance of this, is that which St. <hi>Mathew</hi> gives, <hi>Ye</hi> 
                              <note place="margin">Mat. x. V. 18.</note> 
                              <hi>ſhall be brought before Governors, and Kings for my ſake, for a Teſtimony a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, and the</hi> Gentiles. I might quote many other Places, where our <hi>Saviour</hi> do's expreſly foretell the grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Perſecutions, that ſhou'd be the too common Lot of Chriſtians.</p>
                           <p>Now what Religion is there, in the whole habitable World, that wants the Advantage of a <hi>TOLERATION,</hi>
                              <pb n="45" facs="tcp:60159:137"/>
except that which our <hi>Saviour</hi> intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd? So that there's no Ground, for that fooliſh Plea, which our Enemies make Uſe of, that he ſaw, what bad Entertainment, falſe, and corrupt No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions wou'd naturally meet with in the World; and therefore, to raiſe his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, and promote his Intereſt, did only foretell thoſe Things, which any Child might have known wou'd befall him.</p>
                           <p>But if Perſons wou'd unavoidably be brought before Governors, and Kings, for holding falſe, and wicked Notions, one wou'd think that the <hi>Epicureans,</hi> who disbelieve an over-ruling Povidence, ſhou'd be brought before 'em, as ſoon as any Perſons in the World, or the <hi>Peripateticks,</hi> who think, that the Prayers, which are put up, and the Sacrifices, which are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to the <hi>Gods,</hi> are wholly inſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant, and <hi>little Arts</hi> unworthy to be practic'd by thoſe, who pretend to the Sence, and Learning of Philoſophers.</p>
                           <p>But perhaps our Enemies may object, That the <hi>Samaritanes</hi> are perſecuted on the Account of their Religion.</p>
                           <p>To this I anſwer, that they are condemn'd to dye, for circumciſing themſelves, in direct Oppoſition to the Law, which permits none but <hi>Jews,</hi> to obſerve this celebrated, and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:60159:138"/>
Ancient Rite. And we don't find, that the Judge leaves it to their Choice, whether they will obſtinately perſiſt, and dye, or renounce their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and ſo be publickly acquitted, but if they are found to be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis'd, immediately they muſt ſuffer Death.</p>
                           <p>The Chriſtians are the only Perſons in the World, who, tho' they are perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, according to our Saviour's Predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, <hi>Ye ſhall be brought before Governors, and Kings for my ſake,</hi> are entreated, to the laſt Breath they draw, to renounce the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> and <hi>ſacrifice</hi> to <hi>Idols,</hi> and ſo to put themſelves directly into a ſafe, and happy Condition, with reſpect to their outward Circumſtances.</p>
                           <p>See therefore, with what <hi>Authority</hi> our <hi>Bleſſed Saviour</hi> ſpoke the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Words, <hi>Whoſoever ſhall confeſs me,</hi> 
                              <note place="margin">Mat. x. V. 32, 33.</note>

                           </p>
                           <p>Take Notice, that this was ſpoken by him, a conſiderable Time before the Thing, that he ſpeaks of, was true in Fact. Perhaps ſuch a Thought as this, may be ready to dart into your Mind, that he builds Caſtles in the Air, and what he propheſies don't look at all, as
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:60159:138"/>

                              <hi>Celſus</hi> therefore, might every Jot as well have granted, that our <hi>Saviour</hi> knew what Accidents wou'd befall him, and yet have talk'd with the higheſt Contempt of his <hi>Divine Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,</hi> as grant, that he was capable of working ſuch Miracles, as he wrought, and at the ſame Time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that he was a <hi>Notorious</hi> and <hi>Vile Impostor.</hi> And he might with all his Learning have ſhown, that the <hi>Augurs</hi> and <hi>Auſpices</hi> foretold Future Events, by the Flying of Birds, and by the Intrails of Beaſts.

                              <hi>Phlegon</hi> was much more ingenuous, who in the 13th and 14th Book of his <hi>Chronicon,</hi> acknowledges, that our Saviour foretold Future Events, and ſays, they exactly anſwer'd his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, tho' I obſerve, that he ſeems ſometimes to confound our Bleſſed Lord with the Apoſtle <hi>Peter.</hi>

And as it were, in Spite of Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, he draws this natural Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <q>That ſince the Founder of our Holy Religion, and many of his Followers were able to foretell many future, and remarkable Events at ſo great a Diſtance of Time, which exactly anſwer'd their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, we muſt ſuppoſe, that they were acted by a more than Ordinary Power.</q>
                           </p>
                           <p>Then <hi>Celſus</hi> ſays, <hi>That our Saviour's Diſciples not being able to conceal thoſe Things, which were expos'd to Publick View, thought that the beſt Game they had to play, was to give out that their Maſter foreſaw, a long Time before, all the Accidents that did afterwards befall him.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>But either he didn't know, or at leaſt ſeems to be ignorant, that our Bleſſed Saviour us'd the following Words to his Diſciples, <hi>All ye ſhall be offended becauſe of me this Night;</hi> which <note place="margin">Mat. 26.

                           </p>
                           <p>Now if they hadn't been Men of undoubted Integrity, but had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd to impoſe on our Credulity by falſe Narrations, they wou'd certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:60159:140"/>
have diſcover'd ſo much of <hi>Worldly Policy,</hi> as to have ſaid nothing at all of <hi>Peter</hi>'s Denying his Bleſſed Lord, whoſe Cauſe he had <hi>ſo reſolutely</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd to maintain, and never to have mention'd the Offence which ev'n ſome of the Diſciples took, at the mean Condition in which our Saviour condeſcended, and thought fit to appear; and if theſe Things, which ſeem to repreſent the Followers of our Bleſſed Lord to a great Diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, were not related in the Goſpels, how cou'd <hi>Celſus,</hi> or any other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, have tak'n Occaſion from thence to caſt a Reproach on our moſt Holy Religion?</p>
                           <p>But they were not unwilling, that lateſt Poſterity ſhou'd be acquainted with their Failings, ſince they were well aſſur'd, that this wou'dn't in the leaſt hinder the happy Progreſs of the Everlaſting Goſpel, or give the Reader any juſt Occaſion, to be guilty of the like Irregular Practices.</p>
                           <p>What <hi>Celſus</hi> adds is ridiculous to the laſt Degree, <hi>The Diſciples got this publiſh'd,</hi> ſays he, <hi>to ſecure the Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Maſter, and 'tis as if to prove that a Man is juſt, I ſhou'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in ſeveral Acts of Injustice that he has done, or to prove that he's free</hi>
                              <pb n="52" facs="tcp:60159:141"/>
                              <hi>from Paſſion, I ſhou'd ſhew that he has been guilty of Murder; or, to prove that he's immortal, ſhou'd expoſe his dead Body to View, and after all, put People off with this frivolous Pretence, that he foreſaw whatſoever ſhou'd befall him.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>But here 'tis apparent, that he groſly miſapplies the Inſtances, which he's pleas'd to produce. For there's no Abſurdity at all, in ſuppoſing that our Bleſſed Saviour ſhou'd propoſe himſelf to us, as a Bright Example of <hi>Moral Virtue,</hi> and yet teach us, to ſacrifice our Lives, and all that's dear to us, for the Sake of the Religion we embrace.</p>
                           <p>Conſider alſo, that the Death which he ſuffer'd, is of General, and Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Advantage, as I think, I have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently prov'd already. And tho' <hi>Celſus</hi> do's fondly imagine, that it makes very much for the Cauſe which he eſpouſes, that we don't deny, that our Saviour ſuffer'd in the moſt notorious, and ſhameful Manner; yet this is for Want of knowing the <hi>SACRED MYSTERIES,</hi> that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in the Paſſion of our BLESSED LORD, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> obſerves, and the ſeveral Predictions, which are left upon Record by the <hi>Inſpired Prophets,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this difficult, and important Affair.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="53" facs="tcp:60159:141"/>
Beſides he ſeems not to know, that there was a Celebrated Heretick, who deny'd that the Sufferings of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour were <hi>real.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>This made him ſay, <hi>You don't pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, that his bitter Paſſion was only in Appearance, but, without mincing the Matter, you hold that he ſuffer'd, in a strict, and proper Sence.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>For our Parts, we think, 'tis a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Hereſy, to maintain that our Saviour's Sufferings were only in Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, ſince we muſt then affirm, as the neceſſary Conſequence of the fore-mention'd falſe, and dangerous Poſition, that his Reſurrection, as glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious as we ſuppoſe it to be, was a meer <hi>Deceptio Viſus.</hi> For he that real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dyes, if he riſes again, muſt be really ris'n, and on the contrary, he that dy'd but in Appearance, can only ſeemingly riſe.</p>
                           <p>But becauſe Infidels endeavour, to expoſe the Doctrine of the Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of our Saviour, to the laſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Prophane Contempt, I ſhall take Occaſion to mention here, what <hi>Plato</hi> relates of <hi>Er,</hi> the Son of <hi>Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> 
                              <note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Plato</hi>'s Common Wealth <hi>l.</hi> 10.</note> who at the End of twelve Days roſe out of his Tomb, and told ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral remarkable Tranſactions, that to
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:60159:142"/>
his certain Knowledge had paſs'd in the World of Spirits.</p>
                           <p>And I might mention the Story, which <hi>Heraclitus</hi> tells, of a Woman, who continu'd a conſiderable Time without any Sign of Life, which I think, do's evidently, and not a little, ſerve my preſent Purpoſe, ſince 'tis with Infidels I'm now engag'd.</p>
                           <p>And many pregnant Inſtances might eaſily be produc'd from Hiſtory, of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who have appear'd the Day after their Deceaſe.</p>
                           <p>Is it then any Wonder at all, that one, who in the whole Courſe of his Life did ſo many Actions, which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhort of a Divine Power cou'd poſſibly enable him to perform, who wrought Miracles, to atteſt the Truth of his Doctrine, which were ſo ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing, and ſo open to the View of his moſt implacable Adverſaries, that <hi>Celſus</hi> himſelf has not the Face to deny, that they were true in Fact, tho' indeed he aſcribes 'em to the Power of Infernal <hi>Daemons,</hi> I ſay, is it any Wonder at all, that ſo Divine a Perſon as our Saviour was, ſhou'd have ſomething that was remarkable in his Death, and that his Holy Soul, having freely, and ev'n chearfully left his Body for a Time, ſhou'd re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to it, as ſoon as ever it had
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:60159:142" rendition="simple:additions"/>
perform'd the entire Duty of a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>united Spirit?</p>
                           <p>Our Saviour has the following Words, <hi>No Man takes it from me,</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Life, <hi>but I lay it down of</hi>

                              <hi>my ſelf, I have Power to lay it down, and I have Power to take it up again.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>And perhaps the Reaſon why his Holy Soul made Haſte, to leave his Body, might be this, that his Legs might not be broken, as thoſe of the Thieves were, who were crucify'd by his Sides.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Then came the Soldiers, and brake</hi>

                              <hi>the Legs of the firſt, and of the other, which was crucify'd with him. But when they came to Jeſus, and ſaw that he was dead already, they broke not his Legs.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>So that I have anſwer'd that Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of <hi>Celſus,</hi> how will you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade us, that he cou'd foretell theſe Things?</p>
                           <p>As for that other, <hi>How will you ever make us believe, that a Dead Perſon is immortal?</hi> We ſay 'twou'd ſeem no Wonder at all, if People wou'd but take us right, that he that dy'd was not ſtrictly immortal, but he that roſe from the Dead.

                           <p>They who will take the Pains, to conſult Hiſtorians, may find abundance of ſuch Inſtances as theſe.

                           <p>Nay, many at this very Day, who are not ignorant, to what dreadful Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities the Profeſſion of Chriſtianity will expoſe 'em, and that if they wou'd openly renounce it, they ſhou'd be immediately diſcharg'd, and have their Goods reſtor'd; I ſay, many at this very Day, deſpiſe Life with all

its native, and gawdy Charms, and embrace Death it ſelf, ev'n approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to 'em, in the moſt frightful Shapes.</p>
                           <p>What <hi>Celſus</hi> adds, is as ridiculous as what went before, <hi>If,</hi> ſays he, Judas<hi>'s Treaſon, and</hi> Peter<hi>'s Denial of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster were foretold by Chriſt, one wou'd think, they ſhou'd for that Reaſon, have had an Aweful Senſe of</hi> His Divinity, <hi>and thereby have been effectually ſecur'd from offering ſuch baſe Affronts, to their ſuppos'd Rightful Sovereign, and most Liberal Benefactor.</hi>

                           <p>But here <hi>Celſus,</hi> with all his Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, do's unawares moſt groſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict himſelf, becauſe if our <hi>Saviour</hi> was <hi>GOD</hi> as well as <hi>Man,</hi> then the Events of Things cou'dn't but exactly agree with what his <hi>Infinite Mind</hi> foreſaw concerning 'em, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, the one muſt <hi>
                                 <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>navoidably</hi> betray, and the other by a ſad, but <hi>Fatal Neceſſity</hi> deny him. If Matters cou'd have happen'd otherwiſe, if <hi>Judas</hi> hadn't betray'd, nor <hi>Peter</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd him, being ſufficiently fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warn'd of the Folly, and Danger of committing ſuch horrid Crimes, his Veracity might eaſily have been call'd in Queſtion.

ſhou'd betray him, he alſo foreſaw that Corruption of his Nature, that that inclin'd him to his Treachery, and if he foreſaw, that St <hi>Peter</hi> wou'd deny him, he alſo foreſaw his Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, that was the unhappy Cauſe of his committing ſo baſe a Crime, and this was conſiſtent enough with his permitting him, to be ſurpriz'd into a groſs Act of Sin.</p>

And the like may be ſaid of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> who, after he had ſhamefully deny'd him, <hi>went out, and wept bitterly;</hi> as St. <hi>Mathew</hi> acquaints us.</p>
                           <p>What the <hi>Jew</hi> adds is very ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and childiſh, <hi>If a Perſon,</hi> ſays he, <hi>do's once diſcover the Snares, that are laid for him, and detect his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, they commonly deſiſt from their malicious Purpoſe.</hi> For the contrary is moſt evident, from the Experience of
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:60159:145"/>
all Ages of the World. Then as if he were drawing to a Concluſion, he ſays, <hi>We muſtn't imagine, that theſe Things came e're the more to paſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he foretold 'em, but rather infer from what I have ſaid, that he never did foretell 'em. For 'tis abſurd to ſuppoſe, that either</hi> Judas <hi>wou'd ever have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd, or</hi> Peter <hi>have deny'd him, had they been forewarn'd, and appriz'd of his Prediction.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>But ſince I have already overthrown the Principles, on which his Diſcourſe is founded, the Concluſion which he draws, <hi>viz. We muſtn't imagine, that theſe Things came to paſs, becauſe he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told 'em,</hi> muſt fall to the Ground of Courſe.</p>
                           <p>We ſay the Events happen'd, as Things in their own Nature poſſible, and ſince they came to paſs, we ſee the Predictions verify'd. For the Truth or Falſhood of Prophecies is beſt known by the Event. Therefore what he ſays, <hi>viz. That they didn't come e're the more to paſs, becauſe he foretold 'em, but we must rather infer from what I have ſaid, that he did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver foretell 'em. For 'tis abſurd to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that either</hi> Judas <hi>wou'd ever have betray'd, or</hi> Peter <hi>have deny'd him, had they been forewarn'd, and appriz'd of his Prediction.</hi> This I ſay, is moſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:60159:145" rendition="simple:additions"/>
falſe, and his Inferences are not juſt.</p>
                           <p>Then he ſays, that <hi>If our Saviour was</hi> GOD, <hi>and really foretold theſe Things, as You are apt to imagine, they must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily come to paſs, ſo that a God is ſuppos'd to force his Diſciples to be wicked, with whom he ſeemingly expreſs'd ſo endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Familiarity, when on the contrary, he of all Perſons ſhou'd have been highly ſerviceable to all Mankind, and eſpecially to his intimate Acquaintance, and might have had ſo much Policy, one wou'd think, as to affect thoſe Perſons, who eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous'd his Cauſe. Beſides is it uſual, for Men to betray their Friends, to whoſe Table they are welcome, and where they are civilly, and perhaps very plentifully en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd? Yet here no leſs a Perſon than a</hi> GOD <hi>is ſuppos'd to be betray'd. Nay, a</hi> GOD <hi>(which greatly aggravates the Matter) is ſuppos'd moſt groſly to intrench on the ſacred Laws of Civility, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Friendſhip, and by his</hi> Divine Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, <hi>to make his Diſciples themſelves turn Traitors, and Cowards.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>I ſhall return an Anſwer to this long Invective, rather in Compliance with the ſtrict Injunctions, that are laid upon me, than for the ſake of any Force, that I diſcern in the Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>

                              <hi>Celſus</hi> entertains a fond Conceit, that whatever is foretold by a GOD, do's therefore come to paſs, becauſe it was foretold by him.</p>
                           <p>But here I muſt beg Leave to differ from him, and am, I confeſs, of the Opinion, that he who foretells <hi>Future Events,</hi> isn't properly the Cauſe of their Coming to paſs, at the predicted Time, but that on the contrary, he foreſees, that Things will happen ſo or ſo, whether ever they be foretold or not. And I don't think that his Praeſcience, ev'n upon the Suppoſition that he's GOD, do's in the leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfere with the Poſſibility of Future Events to happen, or not to happen, according to the natural, and regular Courſe of Things, as if barely on that Account, they muſt infallibly anſwer his Prediction.</p>

                           <p>HERE I might produce Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of pregnant Inſtances, from the Sacred Scriptures, and from the Hiſtories of the <hi>Greeks</hi> themſelves, to ſhew, that Future Events are not owing to Predictions, but fall out al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in ſuch a Way, as perfectly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees with the Liberty of the Humane Will. And either my Notion of this Matter is juſt, or what the <hi>Greeks</hi> call <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>, will be no Sophiſm at all, tho' the contrary be very appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, to any Learned, and Judicious Perſon.</p>
                           <p>To render this Matter as intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as may be, I ſhall inſtance in the Prophecies concerning <hi>Judas,</hi> which the Sacred Scriptures do furniſh us with, and ſhall produce one remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable Inſtance of the Truth of my Aſſertion, from the Hiſtory of the <hi>Greeks, viz.</hi> The Anſwer of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Oracle to <hi>Laius.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="64" facs="tcp:60159:147"/>
By the Way, I ſhall here take it for granted, that the Oracle was true, ſince I think, I may make the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, without doing the leaſt Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to the Subject, which I have now in Hand. The Author of the Hundred and ninth Pſalm, ſpeaking in the Perſon of our Bleſſed Saviour, has the following Words, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Traitor <hi>Judas, Hold not</hi> 
                              <note place="margin">Pſal. cix. V. 1.</note> 
                              <hi>thy Peace, O God of my Praiſe, for the Mouth of the Wicked, and the Mouth of the Deceitful are open'd againſt me.</hi> And if you take diligent Notice, you'l find, that throughout the Pſalm, the Prediction muſt be underſtood, in a Sence conſiſtent with the Crime of the Traitor, and his deſerving all thoſe heavy Curſes, that are there mention'd by the Pſalmiſt.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Let 'em fall upon him,</hi> ſays he, by <note place="margin">ibid. 16.</note> a Spirit of Prophecy, <hi>becauſe he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member'd not to ſhew Mercy, but perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted the poor and needy Man, that he might ev'n ſlay the broken in Heart.</hi> 'Tis plain, he might, if he wou'd, have remember'd to ſhew Mercy, and was not forc'd, to perſecute the poor, and needy Man, tho' he miſemploy'd that Power, which God Originally gave him, and actually betray'd his Maſter, and ſo render'd himſelf moſt juſtly obnoxious to thoſe dreadful
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:60159:147"/>
Curſes, which are mention'd in that famous Prophecy.</p>
                           <p>And as for the Anſwer, that the Oracle return'd to <hi>Laius,</hi> which I mention in Favour of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> 'tis related by one of their Ancient <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goedians</hi> to this Effect.</p>
                           <q>
                              <l>Seek not vain Man in Spite of Deſtiny, <note place="margin">Eurip. Phoeniſ.</note>

                              <l>For he who to thy native Heat his Life will owe,</l>
                              <l>With Death it ſelf ſhall ill-requite thy Pains,</l>
                              <l>And dreadful Miſchiefs on thy Houſhould bring.</l>
                           </q>
                           <p>Here 'tis plain, that <hi>Laius</hi> was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der no Neceſſity of begetting an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Son, but if due Care were wanting, a Tragical Scene wou'd preſent it ſelf, and <hi>Oedipus,</hi> and <hi>Jocaſta,</hi> and their two Sons, wou'd ſuffer all thoſe grievous Calamities, which as the Hiſtory acquaints us, did after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards befall 'em.</p>
                           <p>The ſame Sophiſm is frequently made Uſe of as an Argument againſt taking Phyſick, for the Recovery of our Bodily Health, and Strength; If God has decreed, ſays one, that I ſhall be effectually cur'd of my Diſtemper, I ſhall certainly recover my former
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:60159:148"/>
State of Health, whether I uſe any Remedies or no; and if he has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed, that I ſhall not be recover'd from it, whatever Medicines I may take, 'twill infallibly remain upon me, therefore whether he has decreed my Recovery or not, the Endeavours of the Phyſician are equally, that is to ſay, entirely uſeleſs.</p>
                           <p>And the Sophiſm in the Caſe of <hi>Laius,</hi> is very Comical, and runs af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the following Manner, If the Fates have decreed, that I ſhall have a Son, I ſhall certainly have him, whether I am ever concern'd with any Woman or no; and if they have decreed, that I ſhall never have a Son, I ſhall never have one, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I live in the Uſe of Means or no; and therefore whether they have decreed, that I ſhall have a Son, or have determin'd the contrary, no car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Copulation will ever have the deſired Effect.</p>
                           <p>But as 'tis highly abſurd to refuſe Phyſick, which is the uſual, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Method, for the Recovery of our Bodily Health: So 'tis no leſs ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, to abſtain from Carnal Copu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, if a Perſon be deſirous of a Child, ſince 'tis the ordinary, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Method of Humane Generation.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="67" facs="tcp:60159:148" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Theſe Things I mention, becauſe the profound <hi>Celſus</hi> has the following Words, <hi>If Chriſt was God, and did really foretell theſe Things you talk of, they muſt infallibly come to paſs, at the predict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Time.</hi> For I deny, that they muſt <hi>Neceſſarily</hi> come to paſs, ſince 'twas poſſible for 'em to have had a quite contrary Event. But if he only means, that Divine Praeſcience do's, in ſome ſence, neceſſitate the Event, I readily grant it, and this I think, I may vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly maintain, and at the ſame Time aſſert, that 'twas very poſſible, that Matters might have happen'd otherwiſe. But I think, he's far from proving what he boldly aſſerted, viz. <hi>That on the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the</hi> Divine Praeſcience <hi>of our Saviour, 'twill Naturally follow, that he made his Diſciples turn Traitors, and Cowards, and ſo was justly chargeable with their aggravated Guilt.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>'Tis true, that ſince the Heart of <hi>Judas</hi> was, as it were, Open, and Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent to his All-piercing Eyes, our Bleſſed Lord was fully appriz'd of the Helliſh Deſign, which he had form'd, and plainly perceiv'd, that the Reſpect which he had for his Maſter, was not ſufficient, to ſecure him, from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal impreſſion of a covetous Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This made him ſay thoſe Words, with an Eye to <hi>Judas, he that dippeth</hi>
                              <pb n="68" facs="tcp:60159:149" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                              <hi>his Hands with me in the Diſh, the ſame ſhall betray me.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Take Notice farther of the Abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, and Falſhood, of what <hi>Celſus</hi> ſays, <hi>'Tis unuſual,</hi> ſays he, <hi>for Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to betray their Friends, to whoſe Table they are welcome, yet here even a God is ſuppos'd to be betray'd.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>On the contrary, 'tis too well known, that Perſons, who have been engag'd, by the moſt Sacred, and endearing Tyes, have often and moſt ſhamefully betray'd their intimate Friends, and liberal Benefactors.</p>
                           <p>The Hiſtories both of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and <hi>Barbarians</hi> do furniſh us with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant Inſtances of the fore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd Practice.</p>
                           <p>This is what the famous Poet, who dwelt at <hi>Paros,</hi> and is ſo much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd for his Iambick verſes, reproaches <hi>Lycambe</hi> with. For ſpeaking of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenching on the Laws of civil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, he ſays,</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Thou haſt diſſolv'd the Sacred Band of</hi> 
                              <note place="margin">Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lochus.</note> 
                              <hi>Friendſhip, and art Notoriouſly guilty of the baſeſt Treachery.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>But for the fuller Confirmation of my Argument, I ſhall refer the Reader to them, who have apply'd their Minds, to the Study of Hiſtory, both Sacred, and Prophane.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="69" facs="tcp:60159:149" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Then <hi>Celſus,</hi> as if he had undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Arguments, for what he offers, has the following Words, <hi>Nay a</hi> GOD <hi>(which highly aggravates the Matter) is ſuppos'd, to intrench upon the Rules of Civility, and common Friendſhip, and to make his Diſciples turn Traitours, and Cowards.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>But this is more than he can ever prove, unleſs we muſt allow the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, which he draws, to be Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, and juſt, which I am ſure is ſo very weak, that any Child almoſt wou'd ſee thro' it, and be ready to expoſe it.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div n="17" type="chapter">
                           <head>CHAP. XVII.</head>
                           <p>THEN ſays <hi>Celſus, If your Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſuffer'd freely, in Obedience to his Heavenly Father, 'tis plain, that ſince you ſay that he was</hi> GOD, <hi>and that his Sufferings were entirely voluntary, you muſt acknowledge, 'twas impoſſible, that in the midſt of his ſuppos'd Agonies, he ſhou'd have had ſo quick a Senſe of Pain.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="70" facs="tcp:60159:150"/>
But here, tho' he don't perceive it, his Words imply a plain, and very groſs Contradiction. For he will not deny, that our Saviour ſuffer'd freely, in Obedience to his Father, and then certainly he muſt feel ſome Pain, which is inſeparable from the Notion that we have of Suffering; ſince 'tis very ungrateful to Fleſh and Blood, as he can't but know, and is not eaſily reconcil'd, ev'n to the calm Dictates of impartial Reaſon. And if he thinks that all Sence of Pain is immediately excluded, where there is a partial, or ev'n an entire Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Humane Will, why do's he acknowledge that our Saviour e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſuffer'd? In Truth he hadn't re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembl'd us <hi>in all Things, Sin only excepted,</hi> had he aſſum'd the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, without thoſe many Infirmities, and Miſeries, which are its common, and almoſt inſeparable Attendants.</p>
                           <p>So that after his <hi>Voluntary Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi> he was under ſome Sort of Neceſſity to ſuffer, and in ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, the Calamities to which he was expos'd, were occaſion'd by the Malice, and unwearied Endeavours of his cruel Enemies.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="71" facs="tcp:60159:150"/>
And indeed, as I have already ſhown, if he hadn't giv'n his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, it had been impoſſible, that One who was GOD as well as Man ſhou'd ſuffer, but he willingly, and ev'n chearfully embrac'd the moſt painful, and ſhameful Death, from a deep, and moſt affecting Senſe of the vaſt Advantage, that wou'd redound from it, to a degenerate World.</p>
                           <p>Then <hi>Celſus</hi> granting what he wou'd ſeem to deny, has the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Words, <hi>Pray why do's he make ſuch horrid Complaints, and ſo earnestly deſire, that his Sufferings may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented? For he ſays, Father, if it be poſſible, let this Cup paſs from me.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>But here <hi>Celſus</hi> do's plainly, and not a little diſcover his impotent Malice, againſt the Bleſſed Founder of our moſt Holy Religion. For inſtead of admiring the remarkable Integrity, which appears in the Writings of the Evangeliſts, (who might, if they had pleas'd, have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted this Paſſage, which he thinks do's make ſo much for the Intereſt he eſpouſes, but were induc'd by ſeveral very urgent Motives, to relate it) I ſay inſtead of admiring the Sence
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:60159:151"/>
the remarkable Integrity, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in the Writings of the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts, he takes their Words in a Sence, in which they never under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood 'em, and adds ſome Things, that are owing to his own Invention, and takes no Notice of what im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately follows, from whence he might have learn'd, how ſubmiſſive our Saviour was, to the All-diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Will of his ETERNAL FA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THER. <hi>Nevertheleſs,</hi> ſays he, <hi>not as I will, but as thou wilt.</hi> And <hi>Celſus</hi> ſeems to have never read thoſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Words, (which plainly ſhew, how ſubmiſſive a Temper our Bleſſed Lord diſcover'd, under all the grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Calamities, which his Father was pleas'd to bring upon him,) I mean thoſe Words of <hi>St.</hi> Mathew, <hi>Nevertheleſs if this Cup cannot paſs</hi>

                           <p>Our Adverſaries frequently take Notice of thoſe Words, <hi>I kill,</hi> and reproach us with 'em, but they will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully <note place="margin">Deut. 32, V. 29.</note> overlook the following Words, <hi>I make alive,</hi> which Paſſage of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:60159:151"/>
plainly intimates to us, that tho' God do's deſtroy all them, who live in a Courſe of Rebellion againſt him, and are horrid Plagues to their Native Country; yet at length he will make 'em Partakers of a Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and Glorious Life, ſuch a one as will make 'em trample upon this lower, and periſhing World, with the greateſt Diſdain imaginable.</p>
                           <p>They take Notice of thoſe Words, <hi>I will ſmite him,</hi> but the following <note place="margin">Iſa. 57, V. 17.</note> Words, <hi>I will heal him,</hi> are wholly diſregarded.</p>
                           <p>Here God is repreſented to us, as acting the Part of a moſt Skilful Phyſician, who makes grievous, and often deep Inciſions, into the Fleſh of his Patients, not with a Deſign to do it any Prejudice, or put 'em to any needleſs Pain, but to remove the Cauſe of their Bodily Indiſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that which keeps them in a low, and languſhiing Condition.</p>

                           <p>So <hi>Celſus</hi> dwells on thoſe Words of our Saviour, <hi>Father, If it be poſſible, let this Cup paſs from me;</hi> But don't mention the leaſt Syllable of the following Words, which plainly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the entire Reſignation of our

Bleſſed Lord to his Father's. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding, and all-diſpoſing Will.</p>
                           <p>Here a large Field of Diſcourſe preſents it ſelf, which wou'd be of conſiderable Service, to thoſe, whom St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls perfect, <hi>We preach Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> ſays he, <hi>to them that are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</hi>

                           <p>But this I ſhall reſerve to a more convenient Seaſon, and a more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Place, and only perhaps juſt touch upon it, as I paſs along.</p>
                           <p>I have already, and I think more than once obſerv'd, that ſometimes our Saviour's Expreſſions muſt be underſtood of the Perſon of the <gap reason="foreign">

                           </p>
                           <p>So in the Caſe which is now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, we muſt underſtand him ſpeaking as a Man, diſcovering at once the Weakneſs of the Fleſh, and the Willingneſs of the Spirit, the former in thoſe Words, <hi>Father if it be poſſible, let this Cup paſs from me,</hi> and the latter in thoſe Words, <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs</hi>

                           <p>Beſides, 'tis worthy of our Notice, that he don't <hi>abſolutely</hi> pray, <hi>Let this Cup paſs from me,</hi> but expreſſes a moſt profound Submiſſion to his Father's Will, in the following Words, <hi>If it be poſſible.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>I am not inſenſible, I confeſs, that ſome Interpret thoſe Words after the following Manner, that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour foreſeeing what Calamities wou'd befal the City of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and not only ſo but the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Jews,</hi> on the Account of that unjuſt and barbarous Treatment he ſhou'd meet with at their Hands, had ſuch a tender Compaſſion, for this ſinful, and miſerable People, that he deſir'd to be excus'd from Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that he might prevent 'em, from being forſak'n of God, and expos'd to thoſe threatning Calamities, which he had in View.</p>
                           <p>
                              <q>And then 'tis as if he had ſaid, ſince the <hi>Jews,</hi> upon my Suffering, will be ſadly left by that God, who

                           <p>THEN <hi>Celſus</hi>'s <hi>Jew</hi> accuſes our Saviour's Diſciples of Impoſture, <hi>You impoſe on us,</hi> ſays he, <hi>with a Company of Old Wives Fables, and han't the Sence, to give 'em the leaſt Colour of Reaſon, to recommend 'em to the World.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>To this I anſwer, the Evangeliſts cou'd eaſily have omitted theſe Things, if they had pleas'd, and then there had
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:60159:153"/>
been no Room for this horrid Slander. For how cou'd our Enemies, unleſs they wou'd invent Fictions, out of their own fruitful Brain, reproach us, with ſuch, and ſuch Expreſſions of our Saviour, during his moſt bitter Paſſion, if the Evangeliſts had ſuffer'd 'em, as it were, to ſleep in an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Silence?</p>
                           <p>And <hi>Celſus</hi> wasn't ſenſible, that 'twas morally impoſſible for 'em, to allow 'emſelves to be tamely deluded, in the Affair of the Hiſtory of our Bleſſed Saviour, ſo as to be prevail'd with, to look upon him to be no leſs than a God, and the very Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that was ſo frequently, and ſo expreſly Foretold by the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Prophets, and at the ſame Time be convinc'd in their Conſciences, that all that they writ concerning him (at leaſt what ſeem'd to favour him) was made up of Fictions, that were entirely owing to their fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but unhappy Invention.</p>
                           <p>But 'tis plain, that either they were Men of Integrity, and publiſh'd no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but what they firmly believ'd was true, or elſe their Goſpels are fill'd with trifling Fictions of their own, and by Conſequence, they cou'dn't poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be perſwaded in their Minds, that our Saviour was a GOD.</p>

                              <pb n="78" facs="tcp:60159:154"/>
Then <hi>Celſus's Jew</hi> aſſerts, <hi>That ev'n ſome of the Chriſtians, (like Men that are intoxicated by the Fumes of Wine, and don't mind at all what they ſay, or do) have alter'd the Original Text of the Goſpels, ſo that they may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of various, and almoſt infinite Readings.

                           </p>
                           <p>But for my Part, I confeſs, I know no Changes, that the Original Text of the Goſpels has ever undergone, unleſs by Means of the Followers of <hi>Marcion, Valentinus</hi> and <hi>Lucian.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides 'tisn't fair at all, to charge ſuch a Thing as this upon the Chriſtian Religion, as a Crime, and unworthy of its pretended Purity, but thoſe Perſons who were concern'd in the Fact, ought by all the Laws of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice to anſwer for it.</p>
                           <p>And as 'tis no ſolid, tho' a plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and popular Argument, againſt the Heathen Philoſophy, that <hi>Sophists, Epicureans,</hi> and <hi>Peripateticks</hi> have us'd their utmoſt Endeavours, to delude the World, with their falſe, and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Opinions: So 'tis no convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing

                           <p>THEN <hi>Celſus's Jew</hi> finds Fault with the Chriſtians again, for miſapplying, as he fondly imagines, the Scripture-Prophecies to our Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour. But I think, I have ſpoke ſufficiently to this Point already.</p>
                           <p>Beſides, if the Conviction of his Reader was the End which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to himſelf, he ought to have giv'n us a Key, for the right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Prophecies, and might have offer'd, one wou'd think, ſome ſolid Reaſons, why they can by no Means be fairly accommodated to our <hi>Saviour,</hi> and really he needn't have been ſo ſparing of his Time, and Strength, in examining a Matter of ſuch vaſt Importance, and eſpecially,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:60159:155"/>
ſince he confidently affirms, that there are Abundance of Perſons, to whom the Prophecies might more fitly be apply'd.</p>
                           <p>But <hi>Celſus,</hi> it ſeems, isn't ſenſible at all, that tho' ſuch extravagant Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe as this might become one, who is an utter Stranger to the Prophetick Oracles; yet 'tis very improper, to come from the Mouth of any rational, and ſober <hi>Jew.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Indeed, a Perſon of the fore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd Character, will do what lyes in his Power, to evade the Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of Scripture, which we Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians give, but he'll never grant what <hi>Celſus</hi> ſays, <hi>viz.

                           </p>

                           <p>WHAT he adds, that <hi>God never deſtgn'd to bring ſo great a Plague upon the World, as the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> do's ſtrongly ſavour of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of an inveterate <hi>Jew,</hi> who ſupplies his Want of Reaſon, by a vaſt Stock of Impudence, that he has always by him. But I defy <hi>Celſus,</hi> and all the Men in the World, to prove, that a Doctrine, introduc'd by one, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd ſo many Perſons, from the moſt ſcandalous Vices, and effectually engag'd 'em, to enter upon a virtuous Courſe of Life, did deſerve ſo ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a Title, as that which the <hi>Jew</hi> beſtows upon our Holy Religion.</p>

                              <hi>Celſus</hi> adds with equal Inadverten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, <hi>No one,</hi> ſays he, <hi>but a Mad Man, wou'd take your Saviour to be God, or the Son of God, who instead of carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the aweful Stamp of Divinity, bore all the Marks of Infamy and Diſgrace, and eſpecially ſince this Doctrine is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely</hi>

                           </p>
                           <p>But he ought to produce ſome In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of theſe forc'd Interpretations, which he talks of, and theſe Marks of Infamy (as he thinks) which do ſo much diſguſt him, and let us ſee, what it is, that he has to offer againſt us, that ſo the Chriſtians might return him a ſatisfactory, or at leaſt a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Anſwer, if they thought the Matter did require it.</p>
                           <p>He ſays, <hi>That as the Sun, enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning every Thing by its piercing Rays, do's immediately diſcover it ſelf to us, by the glorious Light, which it tranſmits, over the whole Sphere by turns: So your pretended Saviour, had he been God, or the Son of God, wou'd have reſembl'd that glorious Luminary.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>This we ſay, believe, know, and can prove, he did. For when he came into the World, or which is the ſame Thing, when the Sun of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs did but begin to ſhine, and its dazling Rays were intercepted, by a dark, and ſullen Cloud, Juſtice ſeem'd to regain its native Seat, the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Horſes, the Clangor of Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, the Claſhing of Arms, and the piercing
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:60159:156"/>
Groans of Sick, and Wounded Perſons were heard no more; but a wonderful, and happy Calm ſucceeded the late diſmal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions. The All-wiſe GOD ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd Matters, that he prepar'd the Way, for the Succeſs of the Goſpel, by ſubjecting entire Nations to the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> that ſo our Saviour's Apoſtles might not be hinder'd, as otherwiſe they might have been, in obſerving the Orders, which their Bleſſed Lord had giv'n 'em, to teach all Nations. For how wou'd this have been practicable, (I wo'n't ſay eaſy to be done) if People of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Countries had liv'd under Princes of their own, had wanted a mutual, and fair Correſpondence, and had not liv'd under the Juriſdiction of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors.</p>
                           <p>'Tis very well known, that our Saviour was born, in the Reign of the Emperor <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> who brought the greateſt Part of the World under the <hi>Roman</hi> Yoak, and made Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, almoſt, as it were, one Body Politick.</p>
                           <p>This manifeſtly, and greatly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to the Spreading of the Goſpel, not only, as it laid a Foundation for a Freedom of Commerce, but alſo as it happily prevented thoſe dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:60159:157"/>
Wars, which, we have Reaſon to believe, wou'd unavoidably have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd, if all the Nations of the Earth hadn't been united, under one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Empire. For before the Reign of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> the <hi>Athenians</hi> wag'd War with the <hi>Peloponneſians,</hi> and many Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel Inſtances, if it were needful, might eaſily be produc'd from Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. And the ſtrict, and moſt peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Religion, which the Chriſtians embrace, wou'd never; in all Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, have been eſtabliſh'd in the World, as, Bleſſed be God, it is, if our Saviour hadn't been ſeaſonably born, in a Time of profound, and univerſal Tranquility.</p>
                           <p>Then <hi>Celſus</hi> ſays, <hi>That the Chriſtians are guilty of wretched Sophistry, when they have the Confidence to ſay, that he, whom they affirm, to be the Son of God, was the</hi> VERY ETERNAL WORD. And he thinks this is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwerable.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Becauſe</hi> (ſays he) <hi>inſtead of that Pure, and Holy Word, which we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected they wou'd give us an Account of, they only tell us of a miſerable Man; and ſcandalous, Wretch, that ended his Days upon a Croſs, which was certainly the moſt ſhameful, as well as painful</hi>
                              <pb n="85" facs="tcp:60159:157"/>
                              <hi>Death, that he cou'd poſſibly have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>r'd.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>But this Objection has been already anſwer'd, and I have plainly ſhew'd, that <hi>The Firſt-born of every Creature</hi> was pleas'd <hi>to aſſume a Human Body, and Soul,</hi> that at the Creation of the World, God gave a poſitive, and ſtrict Command, and the Perſon, who was concern'd in its honourable, and ſpeedy Execution, was no other than <hi>the LIVING, and CO-ETERNAL WORD.</hi>
                           </p>

                              <hi>And</hi> (ſays he) <hi>'tis a little odd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed (but the Chriſtians can ſwallow any Thing) that the</hi> Carpenter<hi>'s Wife was deſcended, from ſo Noble a Race, and, which is more unaccountable, that ſhe her ſelf ſhou'd know nothing of the Matter.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>But pray what's this to the Affair in Hand? Suppoſe ſhe was igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, that ſhe came from a Noble Family, what I beſeech you, can you infer from thence, to the Prejudice of Chriſtianity? Might it not be true, that ſhe was remotely deſcended, from the common Parents of Mankind, and more immediately from the Kings of <hi>Judah,</hi> whether ſhe knew it, or no?</p>
                           <p>And perhaps <hi>Celſus</hi> thinks, that all the Anceſtors of a Perſon, who is oppreſs'd with Poverty, muſt of Courſe reſemble him in Condition, and that all the Anceſtors of a King did infallibly attain to <hi>Royal Dignity.</hi> But 'twou'd be Loſs of Time, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn an Anſwer, to ſuch ridiculous Diſcourſe as this. For the Age in which our Lot is caſt, will furniſh us, with innumerable Inſtances of Perſons, who came of a Rich, and Noble Family, and yet by ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Accident, or other, were ſoon

reduc'd to a much meaner Condition, than that of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> the Mother of our <hi>BLESSED LORD,</hi> and on the contrary, they whoſe Outward Circumſtances were former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly very inconſiderable, have been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd, by ſome Sudden, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Turn of Providence, to the Higheſt Pitch of External Grandeur.</p>

                           <p>THEN he asks, in his Cavilling Way, <hi>Pray what did</hi> your Jeſus <hi>ever do, that was truly Great, and any Way Worthy of a God? Did he baffle his Enemies, and diſconcert their moſt Politick Meaſures?</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>To this I anſwer, that we are told in the Goſpels, that the Earth ſhook, the Rocks were rent, the Graves were open'd, the Vail of the Temple was rent in two, the Sun ſuffer'd an Eclipſe, and the Earth was cover'd with thick Darkneſs, ev'n ſuch as might be felt. Theſe were ſome of
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:60159:159"/>
the <hi>Aweful Circumſtances,</hi> that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the moſt bitter <hi>Paſſion</hi> of our <hi>Bleſſed Lord.</hi> And I think, <hi>Celſus</hi> wou'd have diſcover'd much more of an ingenuous Temper, if inſtead of relying on the Authority of the Evangeliſts, only when they offer any Thing, that makes, as he thinks, for the Cauſe, which he eſpouſes, he had either wholly rejected the Goſpels, or elſe wholly admitted 'em, and had but thankfully admit'd the <hi>Amazing Condeſcenſion</hi> of the <hi>ETERNAL WORD,</hi> who willingly became <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate,</hi> with this great Deſign, to recover a Degenerate World, from the ſad Ruines of their Firſt Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy.</p>
                           <p>Another very conſiderable Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, that makes for the Honour of our <hi>Bleſſed Saviour</hi> is this, <hi>viz.</hi> That ev'n at this Diſtance of Time, His <hi>NAME</hi> has ſuch an Admirable Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, that it infallibly, and eaſily cures the moſt dangerous Diſtempers, both of Body, and Mind.

                           <p>Then the <hi>Jew,</hi> thinking to ridicule our Saviour, quotes thoſe Words of <hi>Bacchus</hi> in <hi>Euripides.</hi>

                           <p>But here in the firſt Place, I can't but make this obvious Remark, that the <hi>Jews,</hi> of all People in the World, are leaſt fond of the Heathen Poets. However for once, we'll ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe our <hi>Jew,</hi> to differ from all his Country-men, and to expreſs a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Affection, for the Learning of the <hi>Greeks.</hi> And I ask him, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, according to the Rules of any Logick, that he ever read, it ev'n ſeems to follow, that, becauſe our <hi>Saviour</hi> didn't avoid his Sufferings, he cou'dn't have freed himſelf from 'em, if he pleas'd.</p>
                           <p>I think, he ought much rather to believe, what is related to us in the Acts of the Apoſtles, that an Angel ſhook off St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Chains, and deliver'd him from Priſon, and that <hi>Paul</hi> and
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:60159:160"/>
                              <hi>Silas,</hi> who were put into the Stocks, at <hi>Philippi,</hi> a City of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cap'd out of Priſon by a Miracle, and much more wou'd the Power of God have been engag'd, to preſerve our <hi>Saviour,</hi> from the grievous Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, which he underwent, if the Decrees of Heav'n, and the Reaſon of Things hadn't conſpir'd, if I may ſo ſay, to render 'em moſt highly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.</p>
                           <p>For ought I know, <hi>Celſus</hi> wou'd be ready to ridicule thoſe Stories, or perhaps might never take the Pains to read 'em, ſince in all Probability if he had ever minded 'em at all, he wou'd preſently have reſolv'd 'em, as he do's our Saviour's Miracles, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Power of Magick.</p>
                           <p>Then <hi>Celſus</hi> has the following Words, <hi>The Perſon that condemn'd</hi> your Pretended Saviour, <hi>didn't en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure a Puniſhment, comparable to that of</hi> Pentheus, <hi>who was depriv'd of his Senſes, and torn to Pieces.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>But he's ſo horribly ignorant, as not to know, that <hi>Pilate,</hi> conſider'd in his Publick Capacity, was not ſo properly concern'd, in Condemning our <hi>Bleſſed Saviour,</hi> as the whole Body of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation, which,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:60159:161"/>
we ſee, is for that Reaſon diſpers'd, over the whole habitable World, and ſuffers a far worſe Diſtraction, than ever <hi>Pentheus</hi> did.</p>
                           <p>But why do's he make no Mention at all of the troubleſome Dream, that the Wife of the <hi>Roman</hi> Governor had, inſomuch that ſhe ſaid to her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, <hi>Have thou nothing to do with</hi> 
                              <note place="margin">Matxxvii V. 19.</note> 
                              <hi>that juſt Man; for I have ſuffer'd many Things this Day in a Dream, becauſe of him.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Then he leaves out thoſe Things, that are evident, and remarkable Proofs of the Divinity of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's Perſon, and Commiſſion, and takes Abundance of Pains, to dreſs up the LORD of GLORY in a Fool's Goat, by the diſadvantageous, and ludicrous Relation, which he gives, of the horrid Affronts, that were offer'd him, <hi>viz.</hi> The Scarlet Robe, that they put upon him, in a Way of Mockery; the Crown of Thorns, that they put upon his Head, and the Reed, that they put into his Hand.</p>
                           <p>But it may not be amiſs, to ask you the following Queſtion, From whence cou'd you learn theſe Things, but from thoſe very Goſpels, which you take the Liberty to reject at Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure? And if this be the true State
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:60159:161"/>
of the Caſe, how comes it to paſs, I be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſeech you, that ſuch Perſons as you are can take Occaſion, to reflect upon our <hi>Saviour,</hi> from thoſe very Paſſages of Scripture, which, as many others, with great Reaſon, judge, do leave an Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Brand of Infamy on thoſe, who had the horrid Impudence to inſult him?</p>
                           <p>I think, you ſhou'd rather admire the Remarkable Integrity, which appears, in the Writings of the Evangeliſts, and be fill'd with a <hi>Holy Awe,</hi> when you conſider the <hi>Amazing Condeſcention</hi> of the <hi>Bleſſed Jeſus,</hi> who ſeal'd his Doctrine, with his moſt precious Blood. For we have no Account, that, after the Sentence of Condemnation was paſs'd upon him, he made the leaſt Complaint, or ever utter'd a Word, that ev'n ſeem'd to be unworthy of the Greateſt Hero, that the World cou'd ever boaſt of.</p>
                           <p>Then <hi>Celſus</hi> ſays, <hi>One wou'd think, that now, if ever, he had a fair Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, to give full Proof of his pretended Deity, and in the Face, if I may ſo ſay, of the whole habitable World, to be reveng'd of the</hi> Jews <hi>for the baſe Affronts, which you ſee were offer'd, both to him, and to his Dearly-belov'd, and Highly-honour'd Father.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="94" facs="tcp:60159:162"/>
But here I ask thoſe of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> who believe an <hi>Over-ruling Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> and grant that Miracles have been wrought, Pray, why don't the injur'd Deity take that Advantage (as on your <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> he might eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do) which is plainly giv'n him, by thoſe innumerable, and great Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts, which are daily offer'd him, by the bold Aſſertors of a <hi>Blind Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>And when they return an Anſwer to this ſingle Queſtion, all the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which they bring, may eaſily be retorted on themſelves.</p>

This we muſt ſuppoſe to be ſpoken by him, in his uſual Way of Banter, which ſeems to me to be his peculiar Talent.</p>
                           <p>But I ſhall ſhow, that the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, who relate theſe Matters, with a becoming Gravity, and prudent Care, have left behind 'em a true, and ſufficient Account, of the moſt conſiderable Paſſages, that occur'd, let <hi>Celſus</hi> ſay what he pleaſes, to the contrary. They acquaint us, that the Blood, which flow'd from our Saviour's Body, was not fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, like that, which <hi>Homer</hi> ſpeaks of, but that ſoon after he expir'd. <hi>One of the Souldiers with a Spear pierc'd his Side, and forthwith there came out</hi> 
                              <note place="margin">John 19, V. 34, 35.</note> 
                              <hi>Blood, and Water, and he that ſaw it bare Record, and his Record is true, and he knows that he ſays true.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>In Dead Bodies, 'tis common for the Blood to ſtagnate, and we don't uſe, to ſee Water trickle down from the Veins; but when our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi> was dead, Water, and Blood flow'd from his pierced Side, in a praeter-natural Way. And if inſtead of putting an improper, and forc'd Sence, upon ſome Paſſages in the Goſpels, and thereby ſeeking all poſſible Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, to reproach our <hi>Saviour,</hi> and his Followers, one wou'd but dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:60159:163"/>
and impartially conſider the ſtrange Events, which are there rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, one might eaſily perceive, that the Centurion, and they who were ſet to watch the dead Body of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> (who had been Eye-Witneſſes of the Earth-quake, and many other ſurprizing Accidents, that happen'd at that Time) were ſtruck with an unuſual Terror, and ſaid, <hi>Truly this</hi>

                              <hi>was the SON of GOD.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Then our Bigotted Adverſary, who only reads the Goſpels, with a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to pick up ſome Scraps of 'em here and there, which, as he fondly imagines, do make for the Intereſt, which he eſpouſes, ridicules our <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,</hi> on the Account of the Gall, and Vinegar, that was giv'n him to drink.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>He was ſo very thirſty,</hi> ſays he, <hi>that he greedily drank off the bitter Draught.</hi>

under the Old-Teſtament-Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation. For in the 69th <hi>Pſalm,</hi> The Meſſiah is brought in ſpeaking the following Words, <hi>They gave me alſo Gall for my Meat, and in my Thirſt they gave me Vinegar to drink.</hi>

                           <p>Farther, we have great Cauſe to blame em', becauſe they will not ſee that the numerous, and great Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, which the Followers of our <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Lord</hi> did moſt certainly reap, from the <hi>Heavenly Inſtructions</hi> which he gave 'em, were an undeniable Argument, that he aſſum'd <hi>Humane Nature,</hi> with a kind, and generous Intention, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote our <hi>common Intereſt,</hi> and 'twas not his Deſign at his firſt Appearance in the World, immediately to diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute compleat Rewards, and inflict the ſevereſt Puniſhments on Men, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their good or bad Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, but to have his Doctrine pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd to the moſt diſtant Parts, as the Prophets had moſt expreſly fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told, and to that happy End to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company the Preaching of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles with an irreſiſtible Power.</p>

                           <p>For there was nothing mean, or in any Reſpects unworthy of his Character, in all the <hi>ſad Fatigues</hi> which he underwent, but on the contrary, 'twas a great, and highly <hi>Honourable</hi> Action, truly, and every Way worthy of an <hi>incarnate God,</hi> to give wholeſome Precepts, with a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral Hand, to ſuch Perſons, as were capable, of receiving Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from him.</p>
                           <p>What <hi>Celſus</hi>'s <hi>Jew</hi> adds, is moſt notoriouſly falſe, <hi>Not being able, ſays he, during the whole Courſe of his Life, ſo much as to prevail with his own Diſciples, to adhere to him, he was at laſt very ſeverely puniſh'd, as I hope all the World is by this Time ſufficiently inform'd.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>But pray what was it, that ſo greatly excited the Rage, and Envy
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:60159:165"/>
of the Chief Prieſts, Elders, and Scribes among the <hi>Jews,</hi> but the Conſideration of the vaſt Numbers of People, that follow'd our <hi>Bleſſed Saviour,</hi> ev'n into Deſarts, ſome of 'em being ſtrangely charm'd, with the ſweet, and Heavenly Expreſſions, that dropt from his ſacred Lips, and others convinc'd by the <hi>Miracles,</hi> which he had wrought, which fill'd the Minds of his moſt inveterate Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, with equal Malice, and Aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment? And how apparently falſe are thoſe Words, which follow, <hi>That he cou'dn't prevail with his own Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, to adhere to him, but they gave too evident Proofs, of the Frailty of their Nature, by their wretched Cowardize?</hi> For what Malignant Influence ſoever their irregular Fear might have up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Minds, which were not yet duely fortify'd, againſt the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Shocks, of outward, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching Calamities, they were ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſatisfy'd in their own Minds, and were ready, <hi>for the moſt Part,</hi> to profeſs, that our <hi>Bleſſed Saviour</hi> was no other, than the TRUE MES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SIAH.</p>
                           <p>For St. <hi>Peter</hi> had no ſooner deny'd his Lord, but ſtruck with the Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of his Crime, <hi>He went out,</hi>

us, and thoſe of his Diſciples, that we read of, who retain'd a profound Reſpect for their Lord, and Maſter, but were a little amaz'd and for the preſent, ſhock'd, by conſidering the ſad Calamities, which befel him, regain'd that <hi>Native Courage,</hi> when he appear'd to 'em, after his <hi>Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant Reſurrection.</hi> Nay, they not only believ'd, he was the SON OF GOD, but were confirm'd in the <hi>Chriſtian Faith,</hi> and became more Couragious, than ever, under the happy Conduct of the great Captain of their Salvation.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Celſus</hi> thinks, as appears, by the Sequel of his Diſcourſe, there was no real Excellency in our Saviour's Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, nor any Regularity, and Strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, obſervable in his Morals, ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to advance him above other Men, but that, contrary to the Character, which he bore, he ought not to have dy'd at all, or at leaſt there ſhou'd have been nothing in his Death, that might juſtly induce us, to lay down our Lives, when Occaſion offers, for the Sake of our moſt Holy Religion. But to me, I confeſs, this ſeems to be a Notion, not a little unworthy of the Learning, and good Sence, ev'n of a <hi>Heathen Philoſopher.</hi>

On the contrary, our <hi>Saviour,</hi> by dying for Mankind, has ſet us a Bright Example of Patience, under all the Sufferings, to which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God may call us, for the Sake of the True Religion, in Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the ungrounded Prejudices, which the Generality of Men are too apt to labour under, who are Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ready to pay <hi>Divine Adoration,</hi> to the moſt inſignificant Trifle, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then the <hi>Supreme,</hi> and <hi>Truly-Adorable Majeſty,</hi> and viewing Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and Things, in a falſe, or very imperfect Light, are wretchedly, and frequently miſtaken in the Judgment, which they paſs upon 'em. For the greateſt Inſtance of the pretended Piety of theſe Bigots to Idolatry, is to level all their Wit, and Malice, at thoſe Well-meaning, and Truly-religious Perſons, who from a deep Senſe of their indiſpenſible Duty, have entirely devoted themſelves <hi>a Holy, and Living Sacrifice,</hi> to the Great Creator, and Supream Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of the Univerſe.</p>

                           <p>THEN <hi>Celſus,</hi> in the Perſon of the pretended <hi>Jew,</hi> continues his Charge, againſt our <hi>Bleſſed Saviour,</hi> in the following Words, <hi>Your</hi> Jeſus <hi>cou'dn't keep himſelf free from Evil.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>But I think he wou'd do very well, to inſtance in any <hi>MORAL EVIL,</hi> that might juſtly be charg'd upon him.</p>
                           <p>If he means, that our <hi>Saviour</hi> was guilty of ſome Vice, or other, (which muſt be his Meaning, or elſe 'tis plain, that he talks very improperly) 'twill lye upon this vile Caviller, to name any one Vice. if he can, that ever ſtain'd the Life, and obſcur'd the <hi>Bright Character</hi> of the <hi>HOLY JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>But if his Meaning be no more than this, that our <hi>Bleſſed Lord</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was expos'd to many outward, and grievous <hi>CALAMITIES,</hi> ſuch as Poverty, Perſecution, the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:60159:167"/>
Treachery of wicked Men, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the ſhameful, and painful Death, which he ſuffer'd on the Croſs, then I think, we may, with equal Juſtice, bring in a ſevere Charge, againſt ſo great a Man as <hi>Socrates,</hi> who, with all his Philoſophy, and <hi>Moral Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,</hi> cou'dn't avoid falling into innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable external Dangers. And how many of the <hi>Greek Philoſophers</hi> cou'd I eaſily name, who were not only oppreſs'd with <hi>extream Poverty,</hi> but made it the Matter of their <hi>de. liberate Choice.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>For Proof of this, we may have Recourſe, to their own Celebrated Authors.</p>
                           <p>They tell us, that <hi>Democritus</hi> was ſo tak'n up, with Nobler Thoughts, that he had no Leiſure—Hours, to beſtow upon his Farms, that <hi>Crates</hi> gave away the Income of his whole Eſtate, with the greateſt Freedom imaginable, that he might have the better Opportunity, for Philoſophical Speculations, and that <hi>Diogenes,</hi> out of his ſtrange Frugality, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, to ſpend his Life in a Tub; and yet no Man, I think, of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Sence, will, for that Reaſon, entertain hard Thoughts, of ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent a Perſon.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="106" facs="tcp:60159:168"/>
Then <hi>Celſus</hi> adds, <hi>That our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour was far from being regular, and unblameable.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>But let him give an Inſtance, if he can, of any one, among the Numerous Followers of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> who ever obſerv'd him, to do an unworthy Action, or if he refuſes to rely on their united Teſtimony, I think, 'tis fit, he ſhou'd acquaint us, with the Grounds, on which he builds his unjuſt, and heavy Charge.</p>
                           <p>'Tis very unlikely, (to ſay no more,) that our <hi>Saviour</hi> ſhou'd be guilty of the leaſt Breach of any Promiſe, that he ever made, if we conſider, how much, and how readily he conſulted the true Intereſt of his Followers, I mean the Welfare of their Precious, and Immortal Souls.</p>
                           <p>And when we ſee, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, and unlikely Events, which he foretold, at ſome Diſtance of Time from their Accompliſhment, have exactly anſwer'd his Prediction, that his Doctrine is publiſh'd, to all the Nations of the World, and that they, who have embrac'd it, have, meerly on that Account, been brought before Governours, and Kings; we
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:60159:168"/>
can't but be fill'd with a <hi>Holy Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration,</hi> and encourag'd, to have our firm, and entire Dependance, upon his Infinite Wiſdom, Irreſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtible Power, and Univerſal Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                           <p>And ſure I am; that <hi>Celſus</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf can't reaſonably deſire, to have greater Evidence, of the Truth of any Doctrine, than that which our <hi>Saviour</hi> has giv'n us, of the Truth of the Goſpel, unleſs he be ſo wretchedly ignorant of the Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ETERNAL WORD, as to exſpect, that the HUMANE NATURE, which was <hi>aſſum'd</hi> by him, ſhou'd not be ſubject to the common Calamities, which attend Humane Life, and by Conſequence, to imagine, that we ſhou'd want the Brighteſt Example, of Submiſſion to the Will of God, that any Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ever gave.</p>
                           <p>The only Reaſon, if it may be call'd ſo, that can poſſibly be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd, for ſuch an extravagant <hi>Conceit,</hi> is this, that <hi>Celſus</hi> eſteems PAIN the GREATEST E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIL, and PLEASURE the HIGHEST GOOD.</p>

                              <pb n="108" facs="tcp:60159:169"/>
And here he goes a Strain, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond moſt of the Philoſophers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, I mean, of thoſe that believ'd an <hi>Over-ruling Providence,</hi> and allow <hi>Courage,</hi> and <hi>Conſtancy,</hi> and the like Endowments, a Place among the MORAL VIRTUES, which are at once ſo Neceſſary, and ſo Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namental.</p>
                           <p>And our <hi>Saviour</hi> was ſo far, from ſubverting the Foundation of our Faith, by the various, and grievous Calamities, to which he was expos'd, and which in the Event did befall him, that I think, he has tak'n the moſt effectual Method, to confirm it, if we can but divert our Thoughts, from the ſhocking Calamities, that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend Humane Life, to the Bright Objects, and Glorious Entertainments of the Future State, in which we ſhall look, with an Holy Diſdain, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Sin, Satan, and this lower World.</p>

                           <p>THEN <hi>Celſus</hi> has the following Words, <hi>Surely you will not have the Confidence to ſay, that</hi> your JESUS, <hi>being unable to work upon the Minds of Men, in the wretched World, in which we live, went down to Hell it ſelf, to ſee if he cou'dn't make Converts there.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>But our <hi>Saviour</hi> when he was here on Earth, had ſo many, and ſuch zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Followers, that, for that Reaſon, he had abundance of Enemies, and when he was ſtript, as it were, of his Humane Body, did converſe with <hi>Naked Spirits,</hi> in the Infernal Region, to make Converts of thoſe, that were capable, of being duly wrought on, by his powerful Miniſtry, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by of anſwering the <hi>DEEP DE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SIGNS,</hi> of his <hi>ETERNAL,</hi> and <hi>

                           <p>What <hi>Celſus</hi>'s <hi>Jew</hi> adds is, I think, very ridiculous. <hi>If</hi> (ſays he) <hi>after</hi>
                              <pb n="110" facs="tcp:60159:170"/>
                              <hi>you have tamely ſuffer'd your ſelves, to be led aſide, like a Company of prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Fools, you think you need no other Apology, than a few Pityful Arguments, in your own Defence, Pray why mayn't all thoſe Scoundrels, and Villains, (that like</hi> your JESUS <hi>have been publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly executed, according to the juſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merit of their Crimes) be accounted Perſons, who had the Broad-Seal of Heav'n?</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>But nothing, in my Mind, can be more clear, than the wide Difference, between the Exemplary Sufferings of our <hi>Bleſſed Saviour,</hi> and the juſt Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of thoſe, who have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd as Impoſtors, or puniſh'd for ſome ſcandalous Crime. And ſure I am, that no Man can ſhew, with any Colour of Reaſon, that a Perſon can ever be reclaim'd, from the moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Crimes, or indeed from any Immorality, by the Help of <hi>Magick.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Then the pretended <hi>Jew,</hi> compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring our <hi>Saviour</hi> with a Company of High-way Men, ſays, <hi>That by a Parity of Reaſon a Perſon may have the Impudence, to ſay, that ſuch a High-way Man, inſtead of being a Perſon of ſo infamous a Character, was no leſs than a GOD, becauſe forſooth he acquainted his curſed Crew before-hand, that he</hi>
                              <pb n="111" facs="tcp:60159:170"/>
                              <hi>ſhou'd ſhortly ſuffer all thoſe grievous Calamities, which in the Event did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall him.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>To this I anſwer, in the firſt Place, that our Believing our <hi>Bleſſed Saviour</hi> to be the <hi>True Meſſiah</hi> is not meerly, or chiefly founded, on his Fore-telling the dreadful Sufferings, to which he was expos'd, and which for our ſakes he readily underwent.</p>
                           <p>In the ſecond Place, I acknowledge, that the Holy Scriptures acquaint us, that tho' our <hi>Saviour</hi> was <hi>GOD</hi> as well as <hi>MAN;</hi> yet <hi>He was number'd with the Tranſgreſſors,</hi> that <hi>Barabbas,</hi> a Robber, was releas'd, and our <hi>Saviour</hi> crucify'd, and plac'd between two Condemn'd Malefactors. And I grant, that if our Saviour's Diſciples bore any Reſemblance to Thieves, and if 'twas known in the Memory of Man, that Perſons of that infamous Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter did readily expoſe themſelves to the greateſt Contempt, and Scorn, and the worſt Treatment, that Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Wit, and Malice cou'd invent, and if they can rationally be ſuppos'd, to do all this, from a juſt Regard to the <hi>Glory of GOD,</hi> and the Holy Precepts of our <hi>BLESSED RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DEEMER;</hi> then I confeſs, <hi>Celſus</hi> wou'd have had ſome Ground, for

                           <p>But our <hi>Saviour,</hi> who laid down his precious Life, as a Sacrifice for the Sins of Men, and his ſincere Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, (who, by their unparallel'd Sufferings, bore an Honourable Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, to the Truth of his moſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Doctrine, and were the only Perſons, whoſe bare Religion ever brought 'em into Trouble) under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went the moſt violent Perſecutions, from their Enemies, without the leaſt Colour of Reaſon, and contrary to the Known, and Fundamental Laws of Humanity.</p>

                              <hi>All that your pretended SAVIO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>R cou'd do,</hi> ſays he, <hi>was only to get ten wicked Mariners, and Publicans, to publiſh his Doctrine to the World, and 'Iwas more than he cou'd do, after all his big Pretences, to convince ev'n thoſe cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous Animals of its Truth.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>For 'tis plain, ev'n from the open Confeſſion of the <hi>Jews,</hi> that not only ten Perſons were overcome, by the Divine Efficacy of his Doctrine, nor a Hundred, nor a Thouſand, but at one Time four Thouſand, and at another Time a much greater Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and that he wrought upon 'em; to ſo great a Degree, that they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd him into Deſarts, which alone were capable of containing thoſe vaſt Numbers of Perſons, that thro' him did believe in GOD, and where they reap'd great Benefit, from his Exemplary Life, and Engaging Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation.</p>
                           <p>I confeſs, the frequent Repetitions, which <hi>Celſus</hi> makes, do almoſt force me, to be guilty of wretched Tauto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, and make me as impertinent as himſelf.</p>

For if I didn't, in ſome Meaſure, (tho' ſorely againſt my Will) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with his way of Writing, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſome weak Perſons might ſuſpect, that out of wicked Policy I paſſed by his Objections, being conſcious to my ſelf, that I was utterly incapable, of returning a ſatisfactory, or ev'n tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Anſwer.</p>
                           <p>Then ſays he, <hi>Pray isn't it the moſt abſurd Thing in the World, to ſuppoſe, that he, who when he was alive, and us'd all the little Arts he had, cou'd gain no Followers in compariſon, or at least none of any Senſe, or Rank, ſhou'd after his Death, by the Miniſtry of his Apoſtles, ſo ſtrangely influence a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Part of Mankind, as they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented by ſome to do.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>But according to the Rules of ſtrict Reaſoning, which he pretends to be ſo great a Maſter of, he ſhou'd have argu'd thus, if after his Death he furniſh'd his Ambaſſadors, with all neceſſary Abilities, to work upon the Minds of Men, and did actually, and ſo wonderfully move all the ſecret Springs of the Humane Soul; then there's no Queſtion to be made, but that when he was on Earth in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, he made deep Impreſſions on
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:60159:173"/>
the Minds, ev'n of the greateſt <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians,</hi> partly by his powerful Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and partly by his unconteſted Miracles.</p>

                           </p>
                           <p>But the Faith of Chriſtians, in an Affair of this Nature, and Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, is built, I can aſſure him, on no ſingle Argument, how perſwaſive ſoever it may be, but the concurring, and clear Evidence of ſeveral Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, a few of which I have already mention'd.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="118" facs="tcp:60159:174"/>
And I ſhall have Occaſion perhaps, to make Mention of ſome other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, on this Head, not only in my Anſwer to <hi>Celſus</hi>'s Book, entitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led A TRUE RELATION, but alſo in ſome other Treatiſes, if GOD ſhall be pleas'd to afford me that Meaſure of the Aſſiſtance of his Spirit, that will be neceſſary, to accompliſh my Deſign.</p>
                           <p>Then, as if we were ſo weak, as to believe, that our Saviour's <hi>bare Suffering on the Croſs,</hi> was ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to prove, He was the <hi>Son of God,</hi> He ſays, <hi>What if he did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſuffer, can't we instance in many others, that ſuffer'd as well, and as much as he?</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>But <hi>Celſus,</hi> in this Matter, acts the Part of one of the moſt unfair Enemies, which the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion has, who, when they read the Hiſtory, of the Crucifixion of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> immediately imagine, that we FONDLY CANONIZE all Perſons, who were ever ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate, as to hang upon a Croſs.</p>
                           <p>This, any one may ſee, is the common Practice of the Adverſary, I have to do with, who, being ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly unable, to reſiſt the clear Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:60159:174"/>
which the <hi>Miracles</hi> of our <hi>Bleſſed Saviour,</hi> do carry in 'em, of the Truth of our Holy Religion, has the Face, to miſrepreſent 'em to the World, as done by meer Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerdemain, or rather by the Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the <hi>Devil.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>But this Pityful, and Vile Cavil has been ſo frequently anſwer'd, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my ſlender Ability, that really it quite tires my Patience, to repeat Things ſo often, as I ſee I muſt.</p>
                           <p>Then <hi>Celſus</hi> makes us ſay, <hi>That our Saviour was the</hi> SON OF GOD, <hi>becauſe he cur'd the lame, and blind, and rais'd a few from the dead, as we Poor Creatures that we are! are ready to imagine.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>But that, in Spite of all that he can ſay, this Conſideration of it ſelf is a ſolid Argument, to prove, he was the SON OF GOD, is plain, from that Famous Prophecy in <hi>Iſaiah, Then the Eyes of the Blind ſhall be open'd, and the Ears of the deaf ſhall</hi>

                           <p>And 'tis highly improbable, to ſay no more, that the Evangeliſts ſhou'd forge the Account, they give
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:60159:175"/>
us, of ſome, rais'd from the dead, becauſe had they been giv'n, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting Fictions, meerly to ſerve a Turn, they wou'd have giv'n us more frequent Inſtances of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture than we meet with, and of the Reſurrection of thoſe, who had been longer dead, than thoſe, of whom we read in the Goſpels.</p>
                           <p>But their giving ſo few Inſtances of Perſons reſtor'd to Life, ſeems to me, to be as plain a Proof as can be, that the Evangeliſts, whatever <hi>Celſus</hi> may ſay, were Men of <hi>HONEST PRINCIPLES,</hi> and the fartheſt of all Men in the World, except our <hi>Bleſſed Saviour,</hi> from being Perſons of <hi>INTRIEG<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>E.</hi>

And Laſtly in <hi>Lazarus,</hi> who had continu'd ſome Days in the Grave, as the Evangeliſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints us; and I wou'd offer the following Conſideration, to the moſt judicious of our Adverſaries, and at this Time more immediately to the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:60159:175"/>
                              <hi>Jew,</hi> whom <hi>Celſus</hi> perſonates, <hi>viz.</hi> That as in <hi>Eliſha</hi>'s Time, there were many Lepers, but none of 'em were cur'd, that we read of, except <hi>Naaman</hi> the <hi>Syrian;</hi> and many Widows in the Days of the Prophet <hi>Elijah,</hi> but he was only ſent to the Widow of <hi>Sarepta,</hi> in the Country of <hi>Sidon,</hi> (for ſhe alone was thought worthy of the Miracle he wrought:) ſo many Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons dy'd, when our <hi>Saviour</hi> was on Earth, but he only rais'd thoſe from the dead, who, in ſome Sence, had <hi>Q<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ALIFY'D THEMSELVES</hi> for ſo <hi>SPECIAL A FAVO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>R.</hi> And this I am apt to think he did, to typifie ſomething future, and give Mankind convincing Proofs, of the Truth and Excellency of that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, which he introduc'd into the World.</p>
                           <p>And I may ſafely ſay, that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Promiſe he had made, his Diſciples did far ſtranger Things, than thoſe, which he himſelf exhibited to the outward Senſes of them, who were the happy Spectators of his Miracles.</p>
                           <p>For the Eyes of the ſpiritually blind were frequently open'd by 'em, the Ears of thoſe, who once were
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:60159:176"/>
deaf to all the awakening Precepts of Virtue, and Religion, were unſtopp'd, that ſo they might receive the Word of God, and the Promiſe of Eternal Life, and many, who were ſpiritually lame, were cur'd by the Goſpel; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that they don't only leap, but ev'n leap as a Stag, which Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, as <hi>Naturaliſts</hi> obſerve, is an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to Serpents, and happily expels their Poiſon.</p>

                           <p>WHEN our <hi>Saviour</hi> admoniſh'd his Diſciples, to avoid thoſe deſigning Wretches, who confidently affirm'd, they were the <hi>TR<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>E MESSIAH,</hi> and endeavour'd by their curſed Enchantments, to draw Men after 'em, (for 'twas needleſs to admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh 'em, to avoid every triſling, and conceited Impoſtor) he directed his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to 'em after the following Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, <hi>If any Man,</hi> ſays he, <hi>ſhall ſay unto you, Lo! here is Chriſt, or there; believe it not.

                           </p>
                           <p>In another Place he has the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Words, <hi>Many will ſay unto me in that Day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophecy'd in thy Name? And in thy Name cast out Devils? and in thy Name done many wonderful Works? And then will I profeſs to 'em, I never knew you, depart from me, ye that work Iniquity.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>But <hi>Celſus,</hi> confounding the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> with the-Enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Men, breaks out into the following Exclamation, <hi>O the Force of Truth! He himſelf don't ſtick to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint us, as ev'n your own Writings inform us, that many ſhall come, and do the ſame Miracles, that were wrought by him, and on that very ſcore, O mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous Impudence! He charges 'em with being wicked Men, and notorious, and vile Impostors;</hi> and ſays, <hi>That Satan will be the Original Author of their curſed Arts.

                                 <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THORITY, that 'tis owing to a Diſhonourable, and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nhappy Source, and not being able to reſiſt the clear Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Truth, do's, in the very ſame Breath, condemn their Miracles, and his</hi>

                              <hi>own. Now isn't it a most intolerable Thing, that from the very ſame Actions, he, by all Means, must be denominated a GOD, and Others be branded with the Infamous Title of</hi> MAGICIANS?</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>So that his own Mouth condemns him, and we ha'n't more Reaſon, to think, that they were Wicked Men, than that he himſelf was one of the Vileſt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons upon Earth. For he has plainly told us, that Actions of that Nature, were certain Indications of the moſt No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Deceit, and Impiety, and not of a Divine Power, accompanying the Perſons, who perform'd 'em.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>But here 'tis obvious to obſerve <hi>Celſus</hi>'s Malicious Miſ-repreſentation of Matters, ſince our Saviour's Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage is vaſtly different, from what the Pretended <hi>Jew</hi> wou'd fain have it to be.</p>
                           <p>Perhaps he might have had ſome plauſible Pretence, ſor his Prophane Diſcourſe, if our <hi>Saviour</hi> had admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd his Diſciples, to avoid all thoſe, who ſhou'd make their Boaſt of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, and had infinuated nothing of the unjuſt Claim, they laid, to the Title of the <hi>TR<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>E MES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SIAH.</hi>

But ſince we are told, that they gave out, they were the <hi>CHRIST,</hi> (which I think, is a Profeſſion, that Magicians don't commonly make) and ſince we are told, they ſhou'd be Perſons, of very <hi>looſe Morals,</hi> and ſhou'd work ſuch <hi>Miracles,</hi> as were <hi>vaſtly different</hi> from thoſe, which were wrought by our <hi>Bleſſed Saviour,</hi> the Conduct of the <hi>Holy JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S</hi> in this very Affair, is ſo far from carrying the Appearance of the leaſt Impoſture, that to me, 'tis a Convincing Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that both he, and his Diſciples, wrought their <hi>Miracles,</hi> by the <hi>POWER</hi> of <hi>GOD,</hi> and that others, who were acted by <hi>Satan,</hi> did only counterfeit the <hi>Glorious Actions</hi> of CHRIST, and his Apoſtles, and ſo prevail'd with ſome deluded Perſons, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that their <hi>High Pretenſions</hi> were moſt juſt, and reaſonable.</p>
                           <p>The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> acquaints us, how <hi>The Man of Sin, and Son of Perdition, ſhou'd be revealed, and exalt himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove</hi>

Shall every Thing that is evil, be found among Men, and every Thing that is truly-good, be baniſh'd from the World? I think, there's much more Reaſon, to lay down this, as a General, and moſt Excellent Maxim, that where-ever there is any <hi>real Evil,</hi> under the Diſguiſe of ſome real Good, <hi>the oppoſite Good</hi> muſt, at leaſt, be <hi>equal</hi> to it, with Reſpect to its De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.</p>
                           <p>And thus we may ſtrongly argue, from <hi>Miracles</hi> wrought by the Help of <hi>Magick,</hi> to ſuch as are perform'd, by the ſpecial Aſſiſtance of the <hi>Great GOD himſelf.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>We muſt either deny, that any Good or Evil, is to be found in the World, or, on the Suppoſition of the latter, muſt allow the former, and perhaps if we grant the former, we muſt affirm the latter; or at leaſt on the Suppoſition of any <hi>real Evil,</hi> muſt allow an <hi>equal Proportion</hi> of that <hi>real Good,</hi> to which the <hi>real Evil</hi> is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly oppoſite.</p>
                           <p>He that will aſſert the one, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out granting the other, ſeems to me, to talk at the ſame mad Rate, with one, who, confeſſing, that there are ſuch Things as <hi>Sophiſms,</hi> or falſe Shews of Reaſon, ſhou'd deny, that there's any ſuch Thing, as <hi>true Logick</hi> in
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:60159:180"/>
the World, which is widely different from 'em.</p>
                           <p>So that I ſay, if we grant, that there is ſuch a Thing as <hi>Magick,</hi> which has ſo great an Influence upon <hi>wicked Daemons,</hi> as to engage 'em, to lend their ready, and joint Aſſiſtance, to thoſe, who profeſs that <hi>Art,</hi> it na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally follows, that <hi>Almighty God</hi> is oblig'd, in ſome Senſe, to exert his Power, in Performing ſuch <hi>Miracles,</hi> as carry with 'em a convincing Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Truth, they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd to atteſt.</p>
                           <p>The next Thing, I take it, that we have to do, under this important Head, is to examine into the Life, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, of thoſe, who pretend, they have a Power, to produce ſuper-natural Effects, and to enquire, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the wonderful Operations they perform, do any way tend, to the Temporal, and Eternal Advantage of the Souls of Men, and we muſt care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully diſtinguiſh between <hi>Magicians,</hi> who hold a Correſpondence with the <hi>Devil,</hi> and thoſe happy Perſons, who are fill'd with the <hi>Holy Spirit of God,</hi> (whoſe Divine Impreſſions they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience both on their Souls, and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,) who conſult the true, and beſt Intereſt of Mankind, and endeavour
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:60159:181"/>
to make Men Proſelites to the moſt Excellent Religion, that was ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd by a God.</p>
                           <p>Now if an Enquiry of this Kind be neceſſary, to diſtinguiſh true <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles</hi> from thoſe which are falſe, to prevent us from making <hi>Miracles,</hi> where there are really none, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage our Aſſent, to the Truth of 'em, when the Finger of God may very plainly be diſcover'd, then we ſhall find, that the <hi>Miracles,</hi> which were wrought by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and our <hi>Bleſſed Saviour,</hi> were owing to an <hi>Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Appearance</hi> of the <hi>Power of God,</hi> ſince they were Solemn Seals, by which the Truth of the <hi>Jewiſh,</hi> and <hi>Christian Religion</hi> was confirm'd, each of which, we know, was embrac'd by a conſiderable Body, of very Wife, and Virtuous Men.</p>
                           <p>Beſides, how cou'd <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law, which forbids the <hi>Jews</hi> to worſhip Images, and teaches 'em, to raiſe their Minds above all created Beings, and fix 'em, on the Eternal God, the Great Creator, and Sovereign Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer of the Univerſe, I ſay, how cou'd ſuch a Law derive its Original, from the <hi>Horrid Practice</hi> of <hi>Magicians.</hi>

And ſince 'tis a <hi>Jew,</hi> that <hi>Celſus</hi> perſonates, I wou'd humbly deſire him, to reſolve the following Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, How comes it to paſs, that you (who firmly believe, that the Miracles, which <hi>Moſes</hi> wrought, were perform'd, by the <hi>Extraordinary Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Spirit of God,</hi> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to defend 'em againſt thoſe, who ſay, that the Wife Men of <hi>Egypt</hi> did ſtrange Things, by the Help of Magick) can't be prevail'd with, to acknowledge, that our <hi>Bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi> perform'd his Miracles, by an <hi>Immediate Aſſiſtance</hi> from Above, but are ſo ſtrangely fond, of Imitating the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> whom you know, to be your ſworn, and irreconcileable Enemies?</p>
                           <p>For if we may be allow'd, to judge of Miracles, by the Event, and argue in Favour of <hi>YOUR J<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>STLY-CELEBRATED MOSES</hi> from his being rais'd up by Almighty God, to be the HONOURABLE FOUNDER of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Polity, I am ſure, we may ſay far more, in Commendation of our <hi>BLESSED SAVIO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>R,</hi> ſince <hi>the imperfect Moſes</hi> isn't worthy to be nam'd, with the HOLY, and SPOTLESS JESUS.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="134" facs="tcp:60159:182"/>
For, as for <hi>Moſes,</hi> 'tis obvious to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, that he found, ready to his Hand, ſuch Perſons, among the Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as liy'd in a Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Obſervance of Circumciſion, that initiating Rite, and many approved Cuſtoms, which were handed down, by <hi>Tradition,</hi> from Father to Son, and he knew very well, that they were, in a great Meaſure, diſpos'd, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his uſeful Inſtructions, and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe his wholeſome Precepts, when 'twas he, under God, who brought 'em out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the Laws he gave 'em, had the Stamp of a <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Authority,</hi> as You your ſelf ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge.</p>
                           <p>But <hi>Our Saviour</hi> making, in ſome Sence, a much greater Attempt, intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd a Religion, that was in a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner new, and caus'd it, to gain Ground continually, in Spite of all the rooted Prejudices of a different Education.</p>
                           <p>And if 'twas highly neceſſary, that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhou'd convince, not only the <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> but alſo the Common People among the <hi>Jews,</hi> of the Truth of his Doctrine, by confirming it, with thoſe <hi>Miracles,</hi> which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures gives us an Account of, there was at leaſt equal Reaſon, why our <hi>Bleſſed Saviour</hi> ſhou'd take the ſame

                           <p>Nay, 'twas evidently neceſſary, he ſhou'd work far greater <hi>Miracles</hi> than <hi>Moſes,</hi> to wean the bigotted <hi>Jews,</hi> from their Humane Traditions, and prove, by Dint of Argument, and plain Appeals to Senſe, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Obſervation, he was a Perſon, who was TRULY-DIVINE, and in a far more noble Sence, than any of their Ancient, and JUST<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LY—CELEBRATED Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</p>
                           <p>And how was it poſſible, that he ſhou'd be otherwiſe, when the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt Deſign of the Glorious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies under the Old-Teſtament-Diſpenſation, was obſcurely to reveal him, under the Character of the TRUE MESSIAH?</p>

                           <p>The Account which he gives us; of <hi>Rampſinitus,</hi> and <hi>Ceres,</hi> wou'd have come, with a much better Grace, from the Mouth of an <hi>Egyptian,</hi> who, to leſſen the Authority of <hi>Moſes,</hi> might ſay, that 'twas much more probable, that the fore-mention'd Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſhou'd play at Dice together, in the Region of the Dead, and that he, as a Proof of his Deſcent thither, ſhou'd produce the embroider'd Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchief, which he took from the Goddeſs, than that <hi>Moſes</hi> went into the Darkneſs, which God himſelf did inhabit, and that he alone had the Honour, to come near him, as he himſelf gives us an Account.</p>
                           <p>And we, who are the Followers of the <hi>Holy Jeſus,</hi> may make the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Addreſs, to the pretended <hi>Jew,</hi> when he talks at ſo extravagant a Rate, Pray how do you anſwer the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and <hi>Egyptians,</hi> who raiſe many of the ſame Objections againſt <hi>Moſes,</hi> that you offer againſt our <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour?</hi> When you have heap'd up all the Arguments, you can think of, in Defence of <hi>Moſes,</hi> (tho' we think, at the ſame time, that we can ſolidly, and clearly prove him to be a True, and very Eminent Prophet)
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:60159:187"/>
you'll be forc'd, unawares to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. ev'n according to thoſe Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which you your Selves make uſe of, that our <hi>Bleſſed Saviour</hi> did vaſtly, and indeed infinitely exceed him.</p>
                           <p>But becauſe <hi>Celſus</hi>'s <hi>Jew</hi> makes meer Game of the Hiſtories which give us an Account, of the Deſcent of ſome <hi>Heroes</hi> into the Region of the Dead, and their Return from thence, and thinks, that their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended DIVINE SORT OF AB<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SCONDING for a Time, and then coming back again, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king an Appearance upon the Stage of the World, was all Artifice, and Deluſion (as he plainly intimates, when he ſpeaks of the Opinion, that the <hi>Odryſians</hi> had of <hi>Orpheus,</hi> the <hi>Theſſalians</hi> of <hi>Proteſilaus,</hi> and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of <hi>Toenarus</hi> entertain'd of <hi>Hercules,</hi> and <hi>Theſeus,)</hi> I ſhall make it appear, that there is no Manner of Compariſon, between theſe Fables of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and the Account that the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> give us, of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of <hi>Our Saviour.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>'Tis obvious to remark, that theſe <hi>Fabulous Heroes</hi> cou'd deſcend into the Region of the Dead, whenever the Fancy took 'em, and return as ſoon
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:60159:187"/>
as they ſaw Cauſe to do ſo. But ſince <hi>our Saviour</hi> was crucify'd, in the open View of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> and after his Death, was tak'n down from the Croſs, in the Sight of ſo many Witneſſes, what Reaſon have we to imagine, that he feign'd his Deſcent, into the World of diſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body'd Spirits, and his Return to <hi>our World</hi> again, as the <hi>Greeks</hi> have feign'd their <hi>Heroes,</hi> to have often done.</p>
                           <p>Nay, I'm inclin'd to think, that from the Story of theſe <hi>Ancient He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes</hi> we may be furniſh'd, with an Argument, that will take away, in a great Meaſure, the <hi>S<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>PPOS'D INFAMY</hi> of the <hi>CROSS</hi> of <hi>CHRIST.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Had our <hi>Saviour</hi> dy'd, in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Way, and giv'n the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> no convincing Proof, of the <hi>Reality</hi> of his Death, he had certainly been liable to <hi>Suſpicion,</hi> as well as many of the <hi>Heroes</hi> of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> tho' he had really been loos'd from the ſtrong Bonds of the Grave, in which he was ſome Time held.</p>
                           <p>I humbly conceive, therefore, that one principal Reaſon, why he dy'd, in ſo publick a Manner, was this, that no Perſon might have the leaſt Umbrage of Jealouſy, that he <hi>craf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="146" facs="tcp:60159:188"/>
himſelf, to be gone down to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the Dead, and took his own Time to appear again, making the World believe, that he was ris'n from the Dead, when in Truth, he was all this While as much alive as ever.</p>
                           <p>But to remove any ſuch fooliſh Suſpicion, we need only conſider, that his Diſciples moſt willingly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd themſelves to imminent Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, in publiſhing his Doctrine to the World, tho' they were not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, of the rooted Prejudices of Men, againſt it. This certainly, they wou'd never have been tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to do, if their Lord's Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on had been no more than an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Fiction, eſpecially if we conſider, they not only perſwaded others, to lay down their Lives, for the Cauſe of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but with the greateſt Readineſs wou'd, if it were poſſible, have dy'd Ten Thouſand Deaths, to promote it.</p>
                           <p>Then <hi>Celſus</hi>'s <hi>Jew</hi> as if 'twas impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that any one ſhou'd riſe from the Dead, with the ſame Numerical Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, makes Uſe of this raſh Expreſſion. <hi>We must,</hi> ſays he, <hi>conſider, whether any Perſon that was really dead, did</hi>

                           <p>This, One wou'd think, ſhou'dn't come, from the Mouth of one, who bears the Character of a <hi>Jew,</hi> who is ſuppos'd to believe, what we find re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded, in the two Books of <hi>Kings,</hi> 
                              <note place="margin">1 Kin. 17. V. 22.</note> concerning two Children, one of which was reſtor'd to Life by <hi>Elijah,</hi> 
                              <note place="margin">2 Kin. 4. V. 34.</note> and the other by <hi>Eliſha.</hi> And I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, 'twas Matter of our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s Choice, to be educated among the <hi>Jews,</hi> becauſe they were accuſtom'd to <hi>Miracles,</hi> that ſo by comparing what he did, with what had been done, in the former Ages of the World, they might be forc'd to acknowledge, that his <hi>Miracles</hi> deſerv'd the Prefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, by whom, and in whoſe Name, far greater Things were perform'd, than had been done, in the Memory of Man.</p>
                           <p>Then the pretended <hi>Jew</hi> (having produc'd the Hiſtories of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> to ſhew us the ſtrange Artifices, which the <hi>Ancient Heroes</hi> us'd, that People might imagine, that they were ris'n from the dead) directs his Diſcourſe, to thoſe of his Native Country, that were converted to the Chriſtian Faith, in the following Words.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="148" facs="tcp:60159:189"/>
                              <hi>Do you look upon the Accounts, that are giv'n by others, as trifling Stories, and imagine, that the Cataſtrophe of your Senſeleſs Drama is ever the more juſt, or probable, becauſe you endeavour, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn it, with ſome Fine Inventions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe your Crucify'd</hi> Jeſus <hi>gave a moſt dreadful Out-Cry, when he lay at the very Point of Death?</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>To this I anſwer, we believe, that the Account, which you have giv'n, of the <hi>Ancient Heroes</hi> of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> is groſly Fabulous, but we are fully perſwaded, and I think, on very ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Grounds, that the Account, which is giv'n us, of our <hi>Bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,</hi> in thoſe Holy Scriptures, which are common to us both, and of which we make our Boaſt, as much as you your ſelves, is far from deſerving that contemptible Character, which this Gentleman is pleas'd to give it.</p>
                           <p>Therefore, we can never grant, that the <hi>Glorious Miracles,</hi> which were wrought, in raiſing ſome Perſons from the dead, as we are credibly inform'd, were no better than empty Fictions, and vain Amuſements. We believe, that our <hi>Saviour</hi> did <hi>really</hi> riſe from the dead, as the Prophets, and he himſelf had foretold he ſhou'd; and one Thing, among others, that makes
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:60159:189"/>
his Reſurrection the more remarkable, and in which it excell'd that of any other Perſon, is the following Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, that he wa'n't rais'd from the dead, by a Prophet, ſuch as <hi>Elijah,</hi> or <hi>Eliſha</hi> was, but by the <hi>IMME<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DIATE INFL<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ENCE</hi> of rhe <hi>GOD-HEAD.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Hence it came to paſs, that the happy Effects of his Reſurrection were ſo Exrraordinary, and ſo Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.</p>
                           <p>Pray was the Reſurrection of the two Children before-mention'd, a great and diffuſive Bleſſing to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, as we know the Reſnrrection of our <hi>Saviour</hi> was, when the Power of God did ſo eminently accompany the Preaching of the Goſpel, and caus'd it to make ſo deep, and laſting an Impreſſion, upon the Minds, of ſo many of his Hearers, who at firſt were ſtrangely prejudic'd againſt him?</p>

                           <p>THE pretended <hi>Jew</hi> goes on, and is ready to ſplit his Sides with Laughing, at the Earth-quake, and ridicules the more than ordinary Darkneſs, that were the <hi>AWF<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>L CONCOMITANTS</hi> of our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi>'s Sufferings.</p>
                           <p>But this I have already anſwer'd, according to my weak Ability, and produc'd the Teſtimony of <hi>Phlegon,</hi> who acknowledges, that theſe won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Events did really happen, at the Time of our Saviour's Paſſion.</p>
                           <p>Then the <hi>Jew</hi> has the following Words, <hi>You ſay, that he roſe from the dead, (tho' he was far from being able, to ſecure his Perſon, while he remain'd on Earth) and ſhew'd upon his Body all the Marks of his Crucifixion, and the very Print of the Nails, with which his Hands, and Feet were pierc'd.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="151" facs="tcp:60159:190"/>
But what dos this Gentleman mean, by ſaying, <hi>He wa'n't able to ſecure his Perſon?</hi> If he means, that our <hi>Bleſſed Saviour</hi> wa'nt able to ſecure himſelf, from the common Contagion of Vice, and Immorality, what he ſays, is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely, and manifeſtly falſe. For he never ſpoke a Word, or did an Action, that was in the leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decent, or unworthy of an INCAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NATE GOD.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>He was led, as a Sheep, to the</hi> 
                              <note place="margin">Mat. 27 V. 2</note> 
                              <hi>Slaughter, and as a Laneb before her Shearers, was dumb; ſo he open'd not his Mouth. Viz.</hi> By way of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, or Uneaſineſs, as St. <hi>Mathew</hi> acquaints us.</p>
                           <p>But if <hi>Celſus</hi> means, that he didn't exert his Power, to ſecure himſelf, from the outward Calamities, to which he was expos'd, which morally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd, were neither Good, nor Evil; I have prov'd already, from the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels, that he ſubmitted to 'em with the greateſt Readineſs imaginable, and ſhew'd the Reaſons, which juſtify'd his Conduct.</p>
                           <p>Then the pretended <hi>Jew,</hi> having ſpoke of our Saviour's ſhewing all the Marks of his Crucifixion, and
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:60159:191"/>
the very Print of his Nails, ſays, <hi>There was no Witneſs, of the Truth of this ſtrange Account, but one Fanatical Woman,</hi> deſigning to ridicule <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> who ſaw him, after he was ris'n from the dead, as we are told in the Goſpels, and becauſe we are inform'd, that he was ſeen by others, he thought fit to add the following Words, <hi>And perhaps ſome Body elſe, of the ſame wretched Cabal.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Then he plainly diſcovers, that he is one of thoſe, who admire the <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curean Hypotheſis,</hi> when he endeavours, to ſhew, how a lively Idea of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceas'd Perſon may be form'd, in the warm Imagination, in the following Words, <hi>Who was deluded by her own idle Whimſies, or too eaſily believ'd, what ſhe wou'd have to be true, as we know it frequently happens.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>There's a great Deal of Force, if we muſt give any heed to his <hi>idle Whimſies,</hi> in this ſcurrilous Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.</p>
                           <p>But ev'n from hence we may be furniſh'd, with an Argument, to prove the <hi>IMMORTAL S<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>BSISTENCE</hi> of <hi>H<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>MANE SO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>LS,</hi> when they are ſeparated from their Bodies, and the
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:60159:191"/>
unavoidable Conſequence of what he here aſſerts, amounts to this at leaſt, that it ſurvives the Body.</p>
                           <p>For, if as <hi>Plato</hi> obſerves, in his <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues,</hi> about the <hi>H<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>MANE SO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>L,</hi> there are certain Images of dead Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that are ſeen near their Tombs, then they muſt be owing to ſome Cauſe or other. And no Cauſe can be ſo rationally aſſign'd, as the Soul of the deceas'd Perſon, that aſſumes a Body, which is adapted to it.</p>
                           <p>But <hi>Celſus,</hi> who advances the fore-mention'd Notion, wou'd make People dream, while they are tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly awake, and have their Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces about 'em, and ſays, <hi>They too ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily believe, what they wou'd have to be true.</hi> Such Dreams, indeed, as he talks of, are common, when the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily Sences are lock'd up by Sleep, but I think, we can't eaſily account for 'em, when Perſons are awake, unleſs they be troubl'd with Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, or fall'n into a Fit of the Frenzy.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="154" facs="tcp:60159:192"/>
                              <hi>Celſus,</hi> it ſeems, wa'n't ignorant of this, and that made him call <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> a <hi>Fanatick,</hi> tho' the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-Hiſtory ſays nothing like it, and our Saviour's Appearing, after he was ris'n from the dead, and ſhowing all the Marks, that were made in his Crucify'd Body, muſt, according to <hi>Celſus,</hi> be ſolv'd by the Doctrine of the Images of deceas'd Perſons, but, according to the Scripture-Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, (which he's ſo cunning as to uſe, when he thinks that it ſerves his purpoſe) the Matter of Fact ſtood thus.</p>
                           <p>Our <hi>Saviour</hi> call'd one of his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to him, who cou'dn't for his Life believe, that he was ris'n from the dead, with the ſame Body, I ſay, with the ſame Body. For the <hi>Appearance</hi> of <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Souls,</hi> after Death, don't ſeem to be the leaſt Matter of his Doubt.</p>
                           <p>Therefore, 'tis remarkable, that he dos'n't ſay, <hi>Except I ſee him,</hi> but <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept</hi>

                           <p>He didn't queſtion, but that the Soul of a deceas'd Perſon might a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimate a Body, which wou'd be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to the corporeal Eye, and, bear

                           <p>And indeed we don't go about to deny, that the Scripture plainly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints us, that after he was ris'n from the dead, he refus'd to appear ſo publickly, and to all Perſons pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuouſly, as he did before. <hi>He was ſeen of the Apoſtles forty Days, and ſpoke</hi>

                              <pb n="158" facs="tcp:60159:194"/>
And we read in the Goſpels, that he wa'n't continually with 'em, but ſometimes after the Interval of eight Days, appear'd in the midſt of 'em, when the Doors were ſhut, and at other Opportunities appear'd to 'em, in a very different Manner.</p>
                           <p>And St. <hi>Paul,</hi> intimating to us, that he did't ſo frequently appear then, as he had done before, has the following Words, <hi>I deliver'd unto you firſt of all, that which I alſo receiv'd, how that</hi>

                           <p>Here a very difficult Queſtion do's occur, that requires the cloſeſt Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, and that not of ordinary Chriſtians, but of thoſe, who have attain'd to the greateſt Eminency, in the School of Chriſt, <hi>viz.</hi> Why our Saviour refus'd, to expoſe himſelf to
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:60159:194"/>
publick View, after his Reſurrection, as he had done before.</p>
                           <p>There's no need, I think, in a Book of this Nature, (the main Deſign of which is to defend the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, againſt the bold Attempts of its malicious Adverſaries) to give a full, or large Solution of ſo Critical a Point. But I ſhall offer a few Thoughts at preſent, which, I hope, will give the Reader ſome ſmall Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, in this difficult Affair.</p>
                           <p>Tho' our <hi>SAVIO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>R</hi> was but <hi>ONE,</hi> with reſpect to <hi>HIS PERSON;</hi> yet there were <hi>SEVERAL NOTIONS,</hi> under which Mankind did conſider him, and different Perſons ſaw him, in very different Sences.</p>
                           <p>That there were ſeveral Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, in which Mankind did conſider him, is plain from ſuch Expreſſions as theſe, <hi>I am the Way, the Truth, and</hi> 
                              <note place="margin">John 14, V. 6.</note> 
                              <hi>the Life. I am the Bread, I am the Door;</hi> and many other Expreſſions, <note place="margin">John 6, V. 35.</note> that I cou'd eaſily name, if Occaſion <note place="margin">John 10, V. 9.</note> offer'd.</p>
                           <p>That different Perſons ſaw him, in very different Sences, will readily be granted by thoſe, who can aſſign the Reaſon, why he didn't take all the Diſciples with him, into the Mount of Transfiguration, but only <hi>Peter, James,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> viz, Becauſe they
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:60159:195"/>
alone cou'd bear the Brightneſs of ſo glorious a Sight, behold the dazling Luſtre of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> and hear the Voice, that came from Heaven, and the Charming Converſation, which thoſe two Celebrated Prophets had the Honour, and Happineſs, to maintain, with the Bleſſed Jeſus.</p>
                           <p>I'm of the Opinion, I confeſs, that before he went up to the Mountain, <note place="margin">Mat. 5, V 1.</note> and inſtructed his Diſciples, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Beatitudes,</hi> he didn't appear to thoſe, who were brought to him in the Evening, at the Foot of the Mountain, and were cur'd of their Diſtempers, I ſay, he didn't appear to thoſe, who were indiſpos'd, and ſtood in need of his healing Power, in the ſame Manner as he did to them, who enjoy'd a confirm'd State of Health, and were able to go up with him to the Mountain. And as he privately explain'd the Meaning of his Parables, to his Diſciples, whoſe Senſe of Hearing was much quicker, than that of the Common People, to whoſe Ears there was nothing convey'd too often, but an empty Sound: So I believe, there was ſome conſiderable Difference, in their ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, and ev'n their corporeal Sight.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="161" facs="tcp:60159:195"/>
'Tis farther plain, that our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our wa'n't ſeen by all Perſons, after the ſame manner, from the Inſtance of <hi>Judas,</hi> who being about to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray him, ſaid to his Accomplices; <hi>He whom I ſhall kiſs is he,</hi> intimating <note place="margin">Mat 26. V. 48.</note> they didn't know him. And that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of our Saviour, <hi>I ſat daily with you, teaching in the Temple, and ye laid no hold on me;</hi> do's manifeſtly favour the Opinion, which I have here laid down.</p>
                           <p>Since therefore, we have ſuch Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> not only with reſpect to his <hi>Divinity,</hi> which was more latent, and undiſcern'd by the Generality of Men, but alſo with reſpect to his <hi>Humane Body,</hi> the Form of which, I believe, he chang'd, when ever he thought fit to do it; We think, that before his Death (by which he ſpoil'd Principalities, and Powers) he was, in ſome Senſe, diſcernable by all, but afterwards ev'n many of thoſe, who had formerly ſeen him, had not Sences, that were adapted to the Sight of a ris'n Jeſus.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="162" facs="tcp:60159:196"/>
'Twas therefore an Inſtance of his Condeſcenſion to the Weakneſs of Men's Capacities, that he didn't ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe himſelf to Publick View, after he was ris'n from the dead, to Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick View, did I ſay, when 'twa'n't without frequent Intervals, that he appear'd ev'n to his Apoſtles, and Diſciples?</p>
                           <p>For after he had honourably, and happily accompliſh'd the Work of our Redemption, we have Reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that his <hi>Divinity</hi> ſhone with much brighter Rays, thro' the Glaſs, if I may ſo ſay, of his <hi>Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Cephas,</hi> who was, as it were, the Firſt-Fruits of the Apoſtles, was the firſt, that ſaw him, then the Twelve <hi>(Matthias</hi> being choſen, in the Room of <hi>Judas)</hi> then five Hundred Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren at once, then <hi>James,</hi> then perhaps all the <hi>Seventy</hi> Diſciples, and at laſt the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> (as one born out of due Time) who knew very well, why he us'd the following Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Epheſians, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto me, who am leſs than the leaſt of</hi> 
                              <note place="margin">Eph. 3. V<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 8,</note> 
                              <hi>all Saints, is this Grace giv'n.</hi> And perhaps thoſe Words, <hi>Leſs than the leaſt of all Saints,</hi> and thoſe Words, <hi>Born out of due Time,</hi> may have a greater Affinity, than ſome Perſons
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:60159:196"/>
on the firſt View, may be ready to imagine.</p>
                           <p>And as there's no Colour of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, for any One to reflect upon our <hi>Bleſſed Saviour,</hi> for not taking all the Apoſtles with him, to the Mount of Transfiguration, but only three of 'em, when he was going to diſplay the Glory of his Raiment, and the Heav'nly Luſtre of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> who were to diſcourſe with him, in a familiar Manner<hi>:</hi> So neither is there juſt Cauſe, for any one to find Fault with the Account, which we meet with, in the Goſpels; <hi>viz.</hi> That he didn't expoſe himſelf, after his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, to the View of all, but only of thoſe, whoſe Eyes were ſtrong enough, to bear the dazling Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſo glorious an Object. And I think, that the following Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which is us'd by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, To this End Christ both dy'd,</hi> 
                              <note place="margin">Rom 14, V. 9.</note> 
                              <hi>and roſe, and reviv'd, that he might be Lord, both of the Dead, and of the Living,</hi> may have a Reference to the Subject, on which I am now diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing.</p>
                           <p>The Dead, over whom he has a rightful Power, are they of whom the Apoſtle ſpeaks, in his firſt Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to the <hi>Corinthians, The Trumpet,</hi>

ſays he, <hi>ſhall ſound, and the dead ſhall be rais'd incorruptible.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Under the Term <hi>Living,</hi> I conceive he comprehends, not only thoſe, who ſhall be rais'd from the dead, to an Immortal Life, but thoſe alſo, who may be conſider'd by us, in a very different Capacity, I mean thoſe, who will be alive, at the Coming of our Lord, and be chang'd.</p>
                           <p>He ſays, <hi>We ſhall be chang'd,</hi> which Words are brought in by him, after he had ſaid, <hi>That the Dead ſhall be rais'd incorruptible.</hi> And in his firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> he deſcribes the Difference, between the Dead, and the Living, in the following Words, <hi>I wou'dn't have you ignorant, Brethren,</hi> 
                              <note place="margin">1 Theſ. 4. V. 13.</note> 
                              <hi>concerning them which are aſleep, that ye ſorrow not, ev'n as others, who have no Hope, for if we believe, that Jeſus dy'd, and roſe again, ev'n them alſo, who ſleep in Jeſus, will God bring with him. For this we ſay unto you, by the Word of the Lord, that we, who are alive, and remain, to the Coming of the Lord, ſha'n't prevent them, who are aſleep.</hi> The Sence of which Verſes I have giv'n, according to the beſt of my Judgment, in my Comment on the foregoing Epiſtle.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="165" facs="tcp:60159:197"/>
Now we needn't wonder, that our <hi>Saviour,</hi> after his Reſurrection, wa'n't ſeen by all, that believ'd in him, ſince the Apoſtle, writing to the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> as Perſons of mean Attainments, has the following Words, <hi>I deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi>

                           </p>
                           <p>I confeſs, the Scriptures, in which the Characters of infinite Wiſdom are ſo legible, do acquaint us, that our Saviour, before his Death, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd himſelf to Publick View (tho' ev'n here ſome Exceptions muſt be made) but after he was ris'n from the Dead, he was no longer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuouſly ſeen by all, but accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Direction of Heaven, conſulted the Capacities of thoſe, to whom he thought fit to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="166" facs="tcp:60159:198"/>
As we read in Scripture, that God appear'd to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and other Holy Men, tho' there were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Intervals, and we know very well, that he didn't appear to all: So we may rationally ſuppoſe, that the SON OF GOD, when he made his Appearance to Perſons, after he was ris'n from the dead, took a prudent Method, not unlike that, which God had before obſerv'd, in making Diſcoveries of himſelf, to the Ancient Fathers of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church.</p>
                           <p>So that I have return'd an Anſwer, (according to my weak Ability, and as far as I thought, conſiſtent with the Deſign of the preſent Treatiſe) to the Objection which <hi>Celſus</hi> makes, in the following Words, <hi>If Chriſt</hi> ſays he, <hi>had a Mind, to exert his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Power, he ought to have appear'd to his Enemies, to the Judge, who paſs'd the Sentence of Death upon him, and to the whole Body of the People, who, as it were, took up Arms againſt him.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Sure I am, that he acted wiſely, in not appearing to his Enemies, or the Judge, who condemn'd him. For he happily prevented 'em from being ſtruck blind, like the <hi>Sodomites</hi> of old, who lay in wait for the Angels,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:60159:198"/>
who, as the Scripture acquaints us, were kindly entertain'd by <hi>Lot.</hi>

                           </p>
                           <p>The Deſign of our <hi>Saviour</hi> was to ſhew his <hi>DIVINE POWER,</hi> in a Way, ſuited to the Capacities of Men, and the TRUE REASON why he refus'd, to appear ſo publickly, after he was ris'n from the Dead, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, was this, becauſe he was then <hi>too bright an Object,</hi> to be beheld by COMMON EYES.</p>
                           <p>Therefore <hi>Celſus,</hi> as if he had wrack'd his Brains, to the utmoſt, cou'd hardly have thought of any Thing, that had leſs Argument in it, than the following Words, <hi>What! was he afraid, that he ſhou'd be hung upon the Croſs again, when if we may give any Heed to you, he was no leſs than</hi> A GOD? <hi>Beſides I ſuppoſe, you'll hardly ſay, that he came into the World, on Purpoſe to</hi> ABSCOND.</p>
                           <p>But 'tis evident, he came into the World, to be ſeen by few compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, and many of thoſe, who ſaw

                           <p>LET us ſee, what <hi>Celſus</hi> adds, <hi>Had he had a Mind,</hi> ſays he, <hi>to have giv'n a Proof, of his pretended Divinity, one wou'd think, he ſhou'd have</hi> VA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NISH'D, <hi>the very Moment, he was nail'd to the Croſs.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>But this is juſt for all the World like the idle, and prophane Talk of thoſe, who deny an <hi>Over-ruling Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> and are erecting new Schemes, in their warm, and fruitful Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for the more regular Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the World, and have the horrid Impudence to ſay, that had the Affairs of it been left entirely to their prudent Management, the Benefit of the Univerſe had been more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally conſulted, than now it is, tho' many Things in their <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> are poſſible, but ſtill they add to the <hi>ſeeming Irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities,</hi> that we allow to have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd, by their <hi>Fancyful Schemes,</hi> or
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:60159:200"/>
they ſuppoſe that to be done, which, in ſome Reſpects, might have a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Tendency, to the Advantage of the Univerſe, but go, on ſo many, and ſuch weak <hi>Hypotheſes,</hi> as wou'd deſtroy the very Nature of Things, and on both Accounts, are perhaps equally guilty, of apparent, and groſs Abſurdities.</p>
                           <p>But to return a more direct An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to <hi>Celſus,</hi> I might acquaint him, that our <hi>Saviour,</hi> by Virtue of his <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> cou'd have diſappear'd, if he pleas'd, as ſoon as ever he was nail'd, to the <hi>Accurſed Tree.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>This is ſelf-evident to thoſe, who believe, and know that he was GOD. And 'tis plain to them, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult the Goſpels, if they don't only rely on their Authority, ſo far as they imagine, that they ſerve their turn, and think that all is meer Fiction, and Jargon, that makes in the leaſt againſt 'em. St. <hi>Luke</hi> tells us, that <hi>After his Reſurrection he took Bread, and bleſſed it, and brake it, and gave to</hi> Simon, <hi>and</hi> Cleopas. <hi>And when they</hi> 
                              <note place="margin">Luke 24, V. 31.</note> 
                              <hi>had tak'n it, their Eyes were open'd, and they knew him, and he vaniſh'd out of their Sight.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>But I cou'd eaſily ſhew, that 'twas inconſiſtent with the Deſign, which he had, in Coming into the World,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:60159:200"/>
to vaniſh, as ſoon as ever he was crucify'd.</p>
                           <p>And when we read the Hiſtory of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> we muſt not <hi>rest</hi> in the <hi>bare Literal Sence,</hi> as if that were all, that the Holy Ghoſt deſign'd. For every conſiderable Circumſtance, that occur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                           <p>For Inſtance, the <hi>Crucifixion</hi> of our <hi>Saviour</hi> was a Repreſentation, of what is meant by the following Expreſſion of the Apoſtle, <hi>I am crucify'd with</hi> 
                              <note place="margin">Gal. 2. V. 20.</note> 
                              <hi>Chriſt;</hi> And by thoſe other Words, <hi>God forbid, that I ſhou'd glory, ſave in</hi> 
                              <note place="margin">Gal. 6. V. 14.</note> 
                              <hi>the Croſs of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by whom the World is crucify'd unto me, and I unto the World.</hi> His Death was neceſſary, that we might ſay, with the Apoſtle, <hi>In that he dy'd, he dy'd unto Sin once,</hi> and that the righteous, <note place="margin">Rom. 6. V. 10.</note> 
                              <hi>being made conformable to his Death,</hi> might ſay, with the Apoſtle, <hi>If we</hi> 
                              <note place="margin">2 Tim. 2, V. 4.</note> 
                              <hi>be dead with him, we ſhall alſo live with him.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>So his <hi>Burial</hi> was deſign'd, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent our Conformity to his Death, and our Crucifixion with him, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> obſerves; <hi>We are bury'd with him,</hi> ſays he, <hi>by Baptiſm into Death.</hi>
                              <pb n="172" facs="tcp:60159:201"/>
But I ſhall give a fuller Acount of his Burial, of his Tomb, and of the Perſon, that buried him, in a diſtinct Treatiſe, on theſe important Subjects.</p>
                           <p>At preſent, I ſhall only mention, the Linnen Cloaths, in which, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence did wiſely order, that the Body of the <hi>Spotleſs Jeſus</hi> ſhou'd be wrap'd, and the New Sepulcher, that was hewn in Stone, or cut out of a Rock, by <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea,</hi> wherein, as St. <hi>Luke,</hi> and St. <hi>John</hi> obſerve, no Man was ever laid before.</p>
                           <p>It may not be amiſs, to conſider, whether the Account of the Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher of our <hi>Bleſſed Lord,</hi> which has the Unanimous Conſent of Three Evangeliſts, don't carry with it, ſome convincing Evidence of Truth, and whether they, who apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to the <hi>Allegorical Sence</hi> of Scripture, ought not to ſeek for ſome <hi>Myſtical Reaſon,</hi> why our <hi>Saviour</hi> ſhou'd be laid, in a <hi>New Sepulchre,</hi> as St. <hi>Mathew,</hi> and St. <hi>John</hi> acquaints us, and why it ſhou'd be ſuch a one, as St. <hi>Luke,</hi> and St. <hi>John</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wherein no Man had ever been <note place="margin">Mat. 27. V. 60.</note> laid before him. For 'twas highly requiſite, that one, whoſe ſeemingly <note place="margin">John 19. V. 41.</note>
                              <pb n="173" facs="tcp:60159:201"/>
Tragical End was grac'd with ſo uncommon Circumſtances, and ſuch Marks of Honour, that our Saviour, who after he was dead, gave Signs of Life, I mean the Water, and Blood, that flow'd from his pierced Side, ſhou'd have ſomething, that was very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, in his Burial, that as he was free from the leaſt Stain of Moral Impurity, being born out of the ordinary Way, of Humane Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration<hi>:</hi> So his Burial might bear the Marks, of an untainted Purity, which is <hi>Myſtically</hi> repreſented to us, by the <hi>New Sepulchre,</hi> in which he was laid, which was not compos'd, of many Stones, joyn'd together, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Rules of Art, but was one entire Piece, cut out of the Rock, made hollow, and every Way ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apted for the Purpoſe.</p>
                           <p>I might have made ſeveral other Remarks, and from theſe outward Signs have rais'd my Thoughts much higher, in Contemplation of thoſe ſublime Things, which they faintly repreſent.</p>
                           <p>But they wou'd afford ſuch vaſt Plenty, of moſt excellent Matter, as wou'd very well deſerve a diſtinct Diſcourſe, and a conſiderable Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume by it ſelf.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="174" facs="tcp:60159:202"/>
At preſent I ſhall only ſay, 'twas fit, that he, who had deſign'd, to hang upon a Croſs, and to dye, like a Man, ſhou'd be bury'd, in ſuch a Manner, as was ſuitable to his <hi>Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Death,</hi> and ſo anſwer his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter to the laſt.</p>
                           <p>But ſuppoſe, the Evangeliſts had acquainted us, that our <hi>Saviour va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd,</hi> as ſoon as ever he was nail'd to the Croſs, then <hi>Celſus,</hi> and the Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels, ſo hard is it to pleaſe 'em! wou'd have come upon us, and have ſaid, <hi>Good Sirs, What Crotchet came into his Head, that he ſhou'd ſtay, 'till he was nail'd to his Croſs, before he thought fit to vaniſh, or how came he to forget, to take this Matter into his ſerious Thoughts, before he came to the Place, where he was ſhamefully executed?</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>If therefore, they find Fault with the Evangeliſts, for not telling us, that our <hi>Saviour vaniſh'd,</hi> when he was going to be crucify'd, but giving us an impartial Account of Matters, we have more Reaſon to blame them ſeverely, for not believing, that our <hi>Saviour</hi> roſe from the dead, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Reſurrection, appear'd to his Diſciples, tho' <hi>The Doors were ſhut,</hi>

                           <p>BUT I can't conceive, why <hi>Celſus</hi> ſhou'd ſay, that our <hi>Bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi> did <hi>ABSCOND.

                           <p>But this is a meer Slander, as is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently evident, from the Words of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> to thoſe, who endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to apprehend him, <hi>I ſat daily,</hi> ſays he, <hi>with you in the Temple, and</hi>

                           <p>He goes on, and ſays, <hi>Did your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Saviour in his Life-Time, teach his Doctrine, in a moſt Publick Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and after his Reſurrection, only</hi>

                           </p>
                           <p>But that he appear'd only to one Woman, is moſt notoriouſly falſe. For St. <hi>Mathew</hi> has the following Words, <hi>In the End of the Sabbath, as it began to dawn, towards the firſt</hi>

                           </p>
                           <p>And I have already anſwer'd what <hi>Celſus</hi> objects, in the following Words, <hi>When he was crucify'd,</hi> ſays he, <hi>there were Witneſſes enough, but when he roſe from the dead, at moſt he appear'd, only to a ſmall Company of Scoundrels.</hi>

I have ſufficiently ſhown, that our Saviour cou'dn't be ſeen by all, and I ſhall only add at preſent, that all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were capable at Times, of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, with reſpect to his <hi>Humane Nature,</hi> but to diſcern the Bright Rays, or ev'n the leaſt Glimmerings of his <hi>DEITY,</hi> was what exceeded the Capacity of the Generality of Men.</p>
                           <p>I ſpeak now, of his <hi>Humane,</hi> and <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> in Contra-Diſtinction to each other, and not as having a mutual Reference, and cloſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion.</p>
                           <p>But pray obſerve, how weakly <hi>Celſus</hi> talks, having ſaid, <hi>That our Saviour appear'd only to one Fanatical Woman, or perhaps a few Others of the ſame wretched Cabal;</hi> he adds the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Words, <hi>When he was crucify'd,</hi> ſays he, <hi>there were Witneſſes enough, but when he roſe from the dead, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd but to a few, whereas had he had any Brains, he muſt have tak'n the quite contrary Courſe.</hi>

groſly abſurd, <hi>viz.</hi> He muſt be cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cify'd, forſooth, in the Sight but of a ſingle Perſon, and have appear'd to all Men PROMISCUOUSLY, when he was ris'n from the dead, for thoſe Words <hi>He ſhou'd have tak'n the quite contrary Courſe,</hi> will bear no other tolerable Sence, if I am ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of making a Judgment, upon any Thing.</p>
                           <p>Our <hi>Saviour</hi> has acquainted us, with the Perſon, that ſent him, in the following Words, <hi>No Man knows the Father, ſave the Son,</hi> and in theſe Words, <hi>No Man has ſeen God, at any Time; but the only Begotten Son, who is in the Boſom of the Father, he has declar'd him.</hi>

                           <p>He it is, who reveals the Things of God, to his true Diſciples, and we endeavour to form our Scheme of Divinity, upon his moſt excellent Model, who ſometimes tells us, that <hi>GOD is Light, and in him is no Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>

                           <p>The Voice, that came to him from Heav'n, ſaying, <hi>This is my Beloved Son, in whom I am well-pleas'd,</hi> isn't ſaid to be heard by the Multitude, as <hi>Celſus</hi>'s <hi>Jew</hi> imagines, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Voice, which is ſaid to come from the Cloud, was only heard, by thoſe, who went up, with our <hi>Saviour,</hi> to the Mountain. For ſuch is the Nature of a Voice from Heav'n, that it can only be heard, by thoſe, for whom God is pleas'd, for wiſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, to deſign it.</p>
                           <p>I don't ſpeak here, of the meer Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of the Particles of the Air, or any Philoſophical Account, that may be giv'n of a Voice, but of a <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Senfation,</hi> whereby one, who has Spiritual Senſes exercis'd, do's hear God ſpeak, when one, who is deaf, to all the awakening Precepts, of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and Piety, is entirely ignorant of what is ſaid, I mean, as to any valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and laſting Purpoſe, that it ſerves.</p>

                              <pb n="181" facs="tcp:60159:205"/>
This I think, is a ſufficient An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, to thoſe Words of <hi>Celſus, What Need was there, of a Voice from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, ſaying, that he was the</hi> SON OF GOD?</p>
                           <p>And what I have already offer'd, concerning the Sufferings of our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,</hi> is a ſatisfactory Anſwer, I judge, to the following Words, <hi>If he hadn't a Mind to conceal his Power, and obſcure his Glory, then ſure he was born, under a very unhappy Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, or elſe he had never ſuffer'd, and dy'd.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Then <hi>Celſus</hi>'s <hi>Jew,</hi> is pleas'd to draw a Conſequence, which is very unnatural, and unjuſt. For it do's by no Means follow, that becauſe our <hi>Saviour,</hi> by his Sufferings, has taught us to bid Defiance to Death it ſelf, therefore when he roſe from the Dead, he ſhou'd have order'd the whole World, to make a General Rendezvouz, and have publickly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted 'em, with the Reaſon, why he left the Realms of Light, and Glory, and thought it worth his While, to come down, into this miſerable, and ſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                           <p>But I have already ſhown, that when he directs his Diſcourſe to our <hi>Saviour,</hi> or to us, he is pleas'd, to interlard it, with Abundance of ridiculous Stories, that I'm confident, the Evangeliſts never thought of, and it remains, to be prov'd, that we are wounded by our own Weapons, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs his fond Imagination muſt always paſs, for a clear, and ſufficient Proof, of one of the greateſt Untruths, that was ever broach'd in the World.</p>

                           <p>THEN <hi>Celſus</hi> breaks forth into the following Exclamation, <hi>Good God! Can we imagine, that a God ſhou'd come down, from Heav'n to Earth, and yet that Men ſhou'd refuſe to embrace his Doctrine?</hi>

                           <p>And 'tis too plain, that the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of the <hi>Jews,</hi> when God appear'd ſo often to 'em, and wrought ſo many Miracles for 'em, and eſpecially when they were wand'ring, in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as we learn, ev'n from their own Sacred Writings, and their proud Contempt of the Doctrine, which our <hi>Bleſſed Lord</hi> introduc'd, tho' he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd it, with the greateſt Authority, and confirm'd it by Miracles, I ſay, 'tis too plain, that the Carriage of the <hi>Jews,</hi> upon theſe various, and aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Scenes of Action, was owing to the ſame unhappy Cauſe, I mean, their wretched Unbelief.</p>
                           <p>And 'tis no great Wonder, that they didn't believe in our <hi>Saviour,</hi> ſince they did but tread, in the Steps of their long-deſcended Anceſtors, for whom they profeſs to have ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found a Veneration.</p>

                              <pb n="186" facs="tcp:60159:208"/>
Then <hi>Celſus</hi> asks, <hi>What God, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you, did ever appear among Men, and wa'n't credited by 'em, eſpecially if he was ſo Politick, as to ſend 'em Word of his Coming? And how cou'd the</hi> Jews <hi>themſelves, as ſtupid as they always were, be ignorant of a Perſon, whom, 'tis well known, they had for many Ages ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected?</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>But I wou'd fain know of the <hi>Jews,</hi> which were the greater Miracles, thoſe that were wrought in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the Wilderneſs, or thoſe that were perform'd by our <hi>Saviour,</hi> in the open View of his cruel, and malicious Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
                           <p>If they ſay, the former were the greater, then 'tis natural enough to ſuppoſe, that they, who have reſiſted the Evidence of thoſe Miracles, which, in their Eſteem, are the greater, ſhou'd much more deſpiſe thoſe, which, they think, are far inferiour to 'em; I mean the Miracles, that were wrought by our <hi>Bleſſed Saviour.</hi> Or, if they ſay, that the Miracles of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and thoſe which our <hi>Saviour</hi> perform'd, are equal, we needn't wonder, that the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation ſhou'd, at different Times, be guilty of giving Way, to the Workings

of their Horrid Unbelief, in Caſes that on many Accounts, were Parallel.</p>
                           <p>The Moral Law was firſt pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd to the <hi>Jews</hi> by <hi>Moſes,</hi> who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints us, that in thoſe early Times, their Fore-Fathers were chargeable with the fore-mention'd Sin, and many other notorious Crimes.

So that I can hardly think, that <hi>Celſus</hi> can be in Earneſt, when he makes his <hi>Jew</hi> find Fault with our <hi>Saviour,</hi> as exceeding the Bounds of Reaſon, and Modeſty, as often as he us'd ſuch Expreſſions as theſe, WOE BE UNTO YOU, and I FORETELL YOU.

                           <p>And if there be any Force, in what he farther objects, <hi>viz.

                           <p>How then can he have the Face, to ſay, that when the Prophets, and our <hi>Saviour,</hi> ſay, <hi>Woe unto you,</hi> to wean the Minds of Men from their beloved Luſts, they hadn't a ſerious, and compaſſionate Regard, to their precious, and immortal Souls, which they wou'd fain reſcue, if 'twere poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, with a <hi>Kind Cruelty,</hi> if I may ſo ſay, from the ever-burning, and intolerably-ſcorching Flames of the Infernal Lake.</p>

But, perhaps, he dreams 'tis requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite, that the <hi>Great God,</hi> or any other Perſon, who bears the Characters of Divinity, ſhou'd <hi>merely</hi> conſult the Dignity, of his own Excellent Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and act in ſuch a Way, as wou'd not be agreeable to the Capacities of Men, nor proper to perſwade their Wills, and engage their beſt Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
                           <p>And how ridiculous do's he render himſelf, when he ſays, that <hi>our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour wanted Power to perſwade?</hi> I cou'd produce many Parallel Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, from the Writings of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Prophets, and of the <hi>Greeks themſelves,</hi> and know very well, that ſome of the moſt Famous of 'em all, were <hi>unable</hi> to prevail with their <hi>Enemies,</hi> their Judges, and Accuſers, to leave their Vices, and apply themſelves to the Study of Philoſophy, as a happy Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction to a regular Courſe of Virtue.</p>

                           <p>This was fore-told by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, <hi>viz.</hi> That GOD wou'd take an Advantage by the Sins of the <hi>Jews,</hi> not merely to call any ſingle Nation, but to ſelect ſome Perſons, from all Parts of the Earth, that hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Choſen the Fooliſh Things of the World,</hi> he might give an ignorant People very clear Diſcoveries of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Truths, taking his Kingdom from the <hi>Jews,</hi> to beſtow it on the <hi>Deſpiſed Gentiles.</hi>

                           <p>THEN the <hi>Jew</hi> concludes with the following Words, <hi>We ſee, therefore,</hi> ſays he, <hi>that he was a Man, like one of us, as we had Reaſon to believe, both from Reaſon, and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>But I can't for my Life conceive, how our <hi>Saviour,</hi> if he was no more than a Man, cou'd ever be ſo weak, as to imagine, that his Doctrine wou'd obtain, and much leſs meet with the deſir'd Succeſs, that he ſhou'd ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably ſurmount all Difficulties, and Dangers, and prove in the Event ſuperiour to the United Force of the People, Senate, and Emperors of <hi>Rome,</hi> and all Foreign Potentates. If we don't allow, that he had a <hi>DIVINE,</hi> as well as a <hi>H<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>MANE NAT<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RE,</hi> how can we account for his making
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:60159:215"/>
ſo many, and ſo remarkable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts, on a ſudden, when the Diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages were ſo great, which he labour'd under? Had they all been Men of Reaſon, that he had to deal with, I confeſs, the Wonder wou'd ſenſibly abate. But the greateſt Part by far were void of Reaſon, and little better than Brutes, in a Humane Shape, and which is worſe, were Slaves to their unruly Paſſions, and on that Account 'twas far more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to reclaim 'em from their exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant Vices.</p>
                           <p>So that we muſt reſolve this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, into his being the <hi>Wiſdom, and the Power of GOD,</hi> let the Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving <hi>Jews,</hi> and the <hi>Learned Greeks,</hi> gnaſh their Teeth, as much as they pleaſe, or produce what they can to the contrary.</p>
                           <p>And I might ſay, that Inſtances of his Divine Power are not wholly wanting, ev'n at this Diſtance of Time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           </p>
                           <p>We ſhall therefore not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, by the Aſſiſtance of the Holy Spirit, to believe in God the Father, according to the Doctrine of his <hi>ETER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NAL SON,</hi> but ſhall alſo be excited,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:60159:215"/>
by a <hi>Holy Ambition,</hi> to endeavour to convert the ignorant Heathensſ to the Chriſtian Faith, while they by all Means will have it, that we truly are the Perſons, whoſe Ignorance de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves highly to be pity'd, (tho' we know very well, that the Caſe they commiſerate is in Truth their own) and they give it out, that we are guilty of Impoſture, whereas they do but condemn their own frequent, and moſt apparent Practice.</p>
                           <p>I am ſure, if we lead Perſons aſide, 'tis a very <hi>Happy Seducement,</hi> ſince the Eternal Welfare of their Better Part is <hi>Honestly</hi> aim'd at, and <hi>Effectually conſulted</hi> by us, who are honour'd ſometimes with being Inſtruments, in the Hand of <hi>ALMIGHTY GOD</hi> to reclaim 'em.</p>
                           <p>By the GRACE OF GOD, with which, our ſincere, and earneſt, tho' weak Endeavours, do concur, they are prevail'd with, to leave their former Intemperance, or at leaſt make ſome ſlow, and imperfect Advances toward the contrary Virtue, they leave their unjuſt Dealing, or at leaſt approach to the Confines of Juſtice, they renounce their Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Folly, or at leaſt are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:60159:216"/>
into the High-Way, if I may ſo ſay, that leads to the MOST SUBLIME, and MOST USEFUL WISDOM, They leave their Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly, and Sordid Temper, and are inſpir'd, with the NOBLEST KIND OF COURAGE, which appears, on all juſt Occaſions, but eſpecially when they are call'd, to lay down their Lives, and ſeal the Truth of their moſt Holy Religion, with their warmeſt Blood.</p>
                           <p>To conclude, without Doubt, our SAVIOUR is already come, who was expreſly foretold, ev'n by the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Prophets. My Antagoniſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did not a little diſcover his Igno<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rance, in making his <hi>Jew</hi> ſay, <hi>That</hi> A CERTAIN PROPHET <hi>foretold the Coming of the</hi> MESSIAH.</p>
                           <p>But becauſe <hi>Celſus,</hi> who brings in his <hi>Jew,</hi> ſpeaking, as he imagines, agreably to the Principles of Judaiſm, thinks fit, that he ſhou'd break off here, (tho' indeed he adds a ſew Things, that are not worthy to be mention'd) I ſhall here put a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod to my SECOND BOOK.</p>

And if I may but have ſeaſonable, and ſuitable Aſſiſtance from above, I ſhall endeavour in my THIRD BOOK, to anſwer ſome remaining Arguments, if they may be ſo call'd againſt the CHRISTIAN RELIGI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ON, which <hi>Celſus</hi> thought fit to uſe, and endeavours with all his Might to maintain.</p>
